Hailing from the distant, mountainous world of Kopri&aacute;, whose seasons can last for years and whose volcanoes choke entireregions with sulfur gas, these insectoid creatures are perfectly adapted to life in harsh environments.</p>\n<h2>Skath&aacute;ri Names</h2>\n<p>A skath&aacute;ri has a single given name, usually passed down from a prominent ancestor. Throughout their lives, skath&aacute;ri also accumulate titles based on their deeds and accomplishments, which they append at the end of their names as honorifics. The oldest and most well-respected skath&aacute;ri typically have gathered a long list which must be recited to greet them with respect.</p>\n<p><em>Skath&aacute;ri Names</em>. Bmarsk, Drikt, Fraxas, Ruzkor, Skrath, Turur, Xast, Xebraks</p>\n<p><em>Skath&aacute;ri Titles</em>. Bearer of Scars, Dragon-Slayer, Far-Glider, Faster than the Rest, Lifter of Boulders, Master of Swords, Rider of Beasts, Spear-Thrower, Wood-Carver</p>\n<h1>Skath&aacute;ri Traits</h1>\n<p>Skath&aacute;ri have the following racial traits:</p>\n<p><em>Ability Score Increases</em>. Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.</p>\n<p><em>Age</em>. Skath&aacute;ri reach maturity around 15 years of age and live for up to 150 years.</p>\n<p><em>Alignment</em>. Skath&aacute;ri are fierce, impulsive fighters with an innate distrust of the outside world. They tend toward chaotic alignments.</p>\n<p><em>Size</em>. Most adult skath&aacute;ri stand between 6 and 7 feet tall and weigh upwards of 200 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p>\n<p><em>Speed</em>. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>\n<p><em>Adaptive Metabolism</em>. Your body can quickly adapt to a range of extreme environments. You take no damage from the extreme temperatures of space and other harsh environments (see @Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.journals.OaID1mfB6T5VxCKe]{DaM Appendix E: Hazards}), and you can hold your breath for a number of minutes equal to 10 times your Constitution modifier (minimum of 10 minutes). Additionally, you have advantage on ability checks and saving throws against inhaled poisons and gases.</p>\n<p><em>Gliding Wings</em>. You have a pair of membranous wings that you can use to glide clumsily through the air. While falling, you can move up to 10 feet horizontally for every 5 feet you fall, up to your movement speed. Additionally, you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage taken as a result of falling.</p>\n<p><em>Powerful Build</em>. You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</p>\n<p><em>Hooked Claws</em>. Your digits end in short, hooked claws, which grant you a climbing speed of 20 feet. Additionally, you can choose for your unarmed strikes to deal slashing damage instead of bludgeoning damage.</p>\n<p><em>Regenerative</em>. If any part of your body is amputated, but its amputation doesn't kill you, you can fully regrow that part of your body in 24 hours.</p>\n<p><em>Languages</em>. You can speak, read, and write Common and Skath&aacute;ri. Skath&aacute;ri is a choppy, syllabic language that uses many idioms and metaphors. This carries into other languages a skath&aacute;ri might speak; therefore, speaking to a skath&aacute;ri in any language is often a chore if one doesn&rsquo;t know much about skath&aacute;ri culture.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Dark Matter","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"Skathári","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"alwaysActive":true,"effects":[{"modSpecKey":"data.details.race","value":"Skathári","mode":"=","targetSpecific":false,"id":1,"itemId":"O4QfJGcgoeJgezhN","active":false,"_targets":[],"label":"Details Race"},{"modSpecKey":"data.abilities.str.mod","value":"2","mode":"+","targetSpecific":false,"id":2,"itemId":"O4QfJGcgoeJgezhN","active":false,"_targets":[],"label":"Abilities Strength Modifier"},{"modSpecKey":"data.abilities.con.mod","value":"1","mode":"+","targetSpecific":false,"id":3,"itemId":"O4QfJGcgoeJgezhN","active":false,"_targets":[],"label":"Abilities Constitution Modifier"},{"modSpecKey":"data.attributes.speed.value","value":"30","mode":"=","targetSpecific":false,"id":4,"itemId":"O4QfJGcgoeJgezhN","active":false,"_targets":[],"label":"Attributes Speed"},{"modSpecKey":"flags.dnd5e.powerfulBuild","value":"1","mode":"=","targetSpecific":false,"id":5,"itemId":"O4QfJGcgoeJgezhN","active":false,"_targets":[]}]},"betterRolls5e":{"critRange":{"value":null},"critDamage":{"value":""},"quickDesc":{"value":false},"quickProperties":{"value":true},"quickOther":{"value":true},"quickFlavor":{"value":true}},"dae":{"activeEquipped":false,"alwaysActive":true},"magicitems":{"enabled":false,"equipped":false,"attuned":false,"charges":"0","chargeType":"c1","destroy":false,"destroyFlavorText":"reaches 0 charges: it crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.","rechargeable":false,"recharge":"0","rechargeType":"t1","rechargeUnit":"r1","sorting":"l"}},"img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/actors/skath%C3%A1ri-nomad.png","effects":[{"_id":"eSq5eY3AKq97gthK","flags":{"dae":{"stackable":false,"transfer":true,"specialDuration":["None"]}},"changes":[{"key":"data.abilities.con.value","value":1,"mode":4,"priority":20},{"key":"data.abilities.str.value","value":2,"mode":4,"priority":20},{"key":"data.details.race","value":"Skathári","mode":5,"priority":20},{"key":"data.attributes.movement.hover","value":"10","mode":2,"priority":20},{"key":"data.traits.languages.value","value":"skathári","mode":2,"priority":20},{"key":"data.traits.languages.value","value":"common","mode":2,"priority":20}],"disabled":false,"duration":{"startTime":null,"seconds":null,"rounds":null,"turns":null,"startRound":null,"startTurn":null},"icon":"icons/svg/aura.svg","label":"Skathári Bonuses","origin":"Item.O4QfJGcgoeJgezhN","tint":"","transfer":true}],"_id":"6uhHMGScvp7A9EPn"}
