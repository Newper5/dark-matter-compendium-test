The Captain, Dogfighter, and Engineer roles are optional; a captain </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">provides extra actions to the crew, the engineer manages </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">power flow and shields, and a dogfighter detaches from the main ship to target the weak points on enemy craft. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16.000000pt; font-family: 'MrsEavesSmallCaps'; color: rgb(6.200000%, 6.600000%, 16.800000%);\">Initiative </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">When ship combat begins, each character must take a role on the ship to participate. A character's actions with regards to the ship are limited to the role they choose. Entire enemy ships act on a single turn of the initiative order, whereas individual characters act separately. However, if a character is in the role of the Captain, the entire crew can act on a single turn of the initiative order. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16.000000pt; font-family: 'MrsEavesSmallCaps'; color: rgb(6.200000%, 6.600000%, 16.800000%);\">Character Roles </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">Each character on a starship chooses one of the following roles when they roll initiative. Depending on the ship, </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">some roles, such as Gunner, might be occupied by one character, more than one character, or might not exist at </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">all. By contrast, roles like Pilot are usually occupied only by one character. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">A character can switch roles with another character or </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">can switch to an unoccupied role as an action. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13.000000pt; font-family: 'MrsEavesSmallCaps'; color: rgb(6.200000%, 6.600000%, 16.800000%);\">Captain </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">As the captain, you direct the ship's operations and manage the crew. If you choose to be the captain when </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">the ship rolls initiative, you roll initiative for the entire </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">ship. The entire party acts on that turn in the initiative </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">order while you are captain, and you can choose in which </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">order the crew members take their turns. If you leave the Captain role or fall unconscious, the party rolls initiative separately at the end of the next initiative order. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">As a captain, you can use the following actions: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPS'; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Boarding Party. </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">When the conditions for Boarding are met, you can use your action as the captain to form a boarding party (which you can choose to be a part of) and </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">deploy the umbilicus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPS'; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Brace for Impact. </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">You can use your action to brace the ship for damage. Each time your ship takes damage before </span><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;\">the beginning of your next turn, you can roll 1d6 and </span><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;\">subtract the number rolled from the mega damage your </span><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;\">ship takes, to a minimum of 1.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 194\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPS'; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Deep Scan. </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">If your ship is equipped with sensors, you can use your action to order a deep scan of a specific object of interest within range of the sensors. This allows you to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check to examine that object. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPS'; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Fire at Will. </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">You use your action to declare a barrage. One gunner of your choice can then use its reaction to make one attack with a ship weapon. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPS'; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Full Speed Ahead. </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">You use your action to push the engines. The pilot can then use its reaction to move the ship half its movement within the cone of movement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13.000000pt; font-family: 'MrsEavesSmallCaps'; color: rgb(6.200000%, 6.600000%, 16.800000%);\">Dogfighter </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">You deploy in a lighter, more maneuverable vessel to disable enemy fighters and target the vital locations of hostile ships. You can use your action to launch your fighter-sized ship from the main ship or to dock with it while you are adjacent to it. You can only switch roles while your fighter is docked with the main ship. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">Once launched, you can move your fighter's entire speed on its turn and use your action to fire its weapons. Movement and weapon attacks follow the same rules<br />as the Pilot&rsquo;s Move action and the Gunner&rsquo;s Open Fire action, except that moving your fighter doesn't require an action. You can also take the Pilot&rsquo;s Dogfighting action. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">If your fighter drops to 0 hit points and is destroyed, </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">you can use your reaction to eject from the craft in a life </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">pod to survive the explosion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">While acting as a dogfighter, you can take the following special action: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPS'; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Targeted Attack. </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">While you are within 1,000 feet of </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">another ship, you can use your action to attempt to disable </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">one of that ship&rsquo;s systems. When you do so, make an attack targeting the ship with disadvantage. On a hit, you </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">deal damage directly to a system of your choice, a weapon </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">of your choice, or the ship&rsquo;s impulse engines. If the attack is blocked by a shield, the damage is subtracted from the target ship&rsquo;s shield points before it damages any system. Systems, weapons, and engines have 10 mega hit points each. Damage to systems is also deducted from the target ship&rsquo;s hit points. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">If a system or weapon drops to 0 hit points, it is disabled. Any creature operating a weapon when it is destroyed takes normal damage (as opposed to mega damage) equal to the damage dealt. If the engines drop to 0 hit points, the ship is crippled and can only move at half speed.&nbsp;</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 195\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13.000000pt; font-family: 'MrsEavesSmallCaps'; color: rgb(6.200000%, 6.600000%, 16.800000%);\">Engineer </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">As the engineer, you can direct power around the </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">ship and position the ship's directional shield. By default, the shield is forward-facing and active. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">The ship's shield covers only one of the ship's four sides. As a bonus action, you can switch the direction the shield faces. If an attack hits the ship on its shielded side, damage is subtracted from the ship's shield points, rather than its hit points. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">At the beginning of the initiative order, the shield </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">regains half its maximum shield points, rounded up. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">As an engineer, you have the following actions </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">available to you: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPS'; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Directing Power. </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">You can use your action to deactivate the shield and direct its power elsewhere: either to the impulse engines or into one of the ship&rsquo;s weapons. If </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">you invest the power in the ship&rsquo;s engines, the ship&rsquo;s movement speed increases by half until the beginning of </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">your next turn. If you invest the power in one of the ship&rsquo;s weapons, a gunner can make one additional attack using that weapon when they take the Open Fire action. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">Alternatively, you can draw power from the ship&rsquo;s </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">weapons and invest it in the ship's shields. When you do so, until the beginning of your next turn, the ship's shields&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;\">cover two of its consecutive sides, instead of only one, and it regains all of its shield points at the beginning of </span><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;\">the initiative order, instead of only half. In exchange, each gunner makes one weapon attack fewer than normal when they take the Open Fire action.</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 195\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPS'; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Overcharge. </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">If you are a spellcaster, you can use your </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">action to expend a spell slot with a level greater than or </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">equal to the Dark Matter engine's class to overcharge the engine. The shield recharges completely, and until </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">the beginning of your next turn, power is invested in the ship&rsquo;s engines (increasing the ship&rsquo;s movement speed by </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">half) and every gun (allowing each gunner to make one additional attack using that weapon when they take the Open Fire action on their turn). Once you use this ability, you can&rsquo;t use it again for 1 minute. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPS'; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">System Repair. </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">You can use your action to repair a ship system or weapon that has 0 hit points and is deactivated. When you do so, make a DC 15 Intelligence (Technology) check. On a success, the system or weapon regains 1 mega hit point and reactivates at the beginning of your next turn. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPS'; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Void Jump. </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">You can begin the charging process for </span><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;\">a void jump. Once a Dark Matter engine has begun to charge, it will jump in 1 minute. No intervention can stop </span><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;\">or slow this process; once it is begun, nothing short of </span><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;\">destroying the ship can interrupt the jump. The pilot is </span><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;\">responsible for guiding the ship on the jump itself and </span><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;\">rolls on the Jump Navigation table when the jump begins.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 196\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13.000000pt; font-family: 'MrsEavesSmallCaps'; color: rgb(6.200000%, 6.600000%, 16.800000%);\">Gunner&nbsp;</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 194\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 196\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">Acquiring targets and calculating ranges, you fire the shipboard weapons on hostile targets. Many ship weapons don't have any facing rules, but those which do are </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">normally mounted to the front or to one of the sides of the </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">ship. If a weapon has the Facing property, it can only be fired in a 90-degree cone in the direction in which it was mounted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">While you are in the Gunner role, you can only operate </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">one of the ship&rsquo;s weapons at a time. You can use a bonus action on your turn to switch between weapons. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">You add your proficiency bonus and Dexterity modifier to an attack roll you make with a ship&rsquo;s weapon, but you don't add any ability modifier to the weapon&rsquo;s damage rolls. Weapon entries in the Example Ships section include an example attack bonus, to be used only if the GM controls the ship as an NPC. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">As a gunner, you can take the following actions: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPS'; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Open Fire. </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">You can take the Attack action on your turn to attack with one of the ship&rsquo;s weapons. You can make multiple attacks with this weapon if you have a feature, such as Extra Attack, that gives you extra attacks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPS'; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Readied Attacks. </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">You can use your action to ready an attack with a ship&rsquo;s weapon, just as you would ready an attack with a normal weapon. Often, this readied action </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">is used to target deployed weapons, such as neutron </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">torpedoes, the moment they are launched, or to strike another ship the moment it opens fire. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13.000000pt; font-family: 'MrsEavesSmallCaps'; color: rgb(6.200000%, 6.600000%, 16.800000%);\">Pilot </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">As the pilot, you navigate and direct the ship's movement. Each ship has a given speed in hundreds of feet per turn, and a maneuverability score, which is given in degrees. </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">Additionally, each ship </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPS'; font-weight: bold;\">faces </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">a particular direction, </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">which is normally in 45-degree intervals, and can be approximated using the eight cardinal directions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">To approximate momentum, each ship's movement </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">is limited to a </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPS'; font-weight: bold;\">cone of movement</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">, which extends in the direction your ship is facing and is as wide as the ship&rsquo;s </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">Maneuverability score, measured in degrees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">As the ship&rsquo;s pilot, you can use the following special </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">actions: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPS'; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Move. </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">You use your action to move the ship up to its speed within the ship&rsquo;s cone of movement.

When you do&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;\">so, until the beginning of your next turn, you add your </span><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;\">Dexterity modifier to the ship's AC and have advantage on Dexterity saving throws you make on behalf of the ship.</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 196\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPS'; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Dogfighting. </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">If your ship is Corvette-sized or smaller and a ship of the same size classification is behind you within 1,000 feet, you can use your action to perform a complex maneuver. Make a Dexterity (Piloting) check, contested by the other ship. On a success, following several tight turns, you switch places with that ship. The direction both ships face remains the same. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPS'; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Hard Turn. </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">If your ship is Corvette-sized or smaller, </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">you can use your action to pull a hard turn, rotating your </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">ship almost on the spot. You move your ship 500 feet in any direction and rotate to face any way you choose. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPS'; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Match Speed. </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">Your ship attempts to move at the same </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">rate and direction as another ship instead of moving </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">normally. Choose one ship that you can see. Until the </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">beginning of your next turn, your ship moves when that ship does and attempts to maintain the same distance from </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">it and angle to it. If the target ship moves faster, is more maneuverable, or uses Hard Turn to perform a movement you are not normally capable of, this effect ends. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPS'; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Ram. </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">If your ship is Frigate-sized or smaller (and </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">you feel particularly foolhardy), you can ram your ship directly into a target by moving up to your speed within your cone of movement and entering a ship or mega </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">creature&rsquo;s space. Your ship and the target each take 2d10 mega bludgeoning damage. Larger ships deal and take more damage in a ram: Transport ships deal 3d10, Corvettes and Frigates deal 4d10. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16.000000pt; font-family: 'MrsEavesSmallCaps'; color: rgb(6.200000%, 6.600000%, 16.800000%);\">Damage and Repair </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">A ship&rsquo;s hit points are given in mega points and ship- based weapons usually deal damage in mega points as </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">well. Optionally, the GM can rule that non-mega damage can&rsquo;t affect things which have mega hit points, and that mega damage is instantly lethal to non-mega targets. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">When a ship takes hit point damage, it represents structural damage to its hull which is not easily repaired. The loss of hit points has no effect on a ship&rsquo;s capabilities until the ship drops to 0 hit points. Individual systems and weapons, however, can be disabled by precision strikes, which is separate from normal hit point damage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">Ships are immune to poison and psychic damage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPS'; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Shield Points. </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">If a ship has a shield generator, hit<br /></span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">point damage might instead be subtracted from the ship&rsquo;s </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">shield points (SP), which are measured in mega hit points. Shields only cover a part of a ship, normally only one side. If the shortest line from an attacker to a shielded ship </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">lands on a shielded side (or a corner of a shielded side), </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">damage is subtracted from the ship's shield points, rather&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 10pt;\">than its hit points. If an attack reduces the shield to 0 shield points, any excess damage carries over to hit points.</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 197\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">A ship with a shield regains half its maximum shield points, rounded up, at the beginning of the engineer&rsquo;s turn (or the start of the initiative order, if the ship has no </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">engineer). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13.000000pt; font-family: 'MrsEavesSmallCaps'; color: rgb(6.200000%, 6.600000%, 16.800000%);\">Destruction </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">When a ship drops to 0 hit points, it becomes a blazing wreck. All of its systems, including weapons, engines, </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">and life support, cease to function, and it can&rsquo;t regain hit </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">points. Escape craft, like fighters, life pods, and shuttles can still eject from a blazing wreck. The ship is on a </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">tipping point of complete disaster; it might soon explode </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">outright, or otherwise become a derelict wreck. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPS'; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Explosion Saving Throws. </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">If the ship is a blazing wreck at the end of the initiative order, one character makes a unique saving throw, called an explosion saving throw. This saving throw isn&rsquo;t tied to any ability score; it is purely dependent on chance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, the ship becomes a derelict wreck; it is adrift, and all its systems are still disabled, but it is no longer at risk of exploding and can, with extensive efforts, be repaired. On your third failure, the ship explodes, immediately killing any creatures still onboard. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPS'; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Damage at 0 Hit Points. </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">If your ship takes any damage while it is a blazing wreck, it suffers an explosion saving throw failure. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13.000000pt; font-family: 'MrsEavesSmallCaps'; color: rgb(6.200000%, 6.600000%, 16.800000%);\">Repair </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">Repairing a ship is a difficult process requiring many hours of work. During your downtime, you can perform repairs on your ship. For each day you spend performing repairs, you make a DC 15 Intelligence (Technology) check. If you have proficiency in ship maintenance tools, you can add your proficiency bonus to the check, or double your proficiency bonus if you are also proficient with Technology. On a success, the ship regains mega hit points equal to your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. Alternatively, the ship can be repaired completely in one day at port for a fee of 2 gp per mega hit point lost. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13.000000pt; font-family: 'MrsEavesSmallCaps'; color: rgb(6.200000%, 6.600000%, 16.800000%);\">Boarding </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">Sometimes, your objective in ship-to-ship combat requires that you come aboard a hostile vessel. You can board </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">another vessel if your ship has an umbilicus, if both ships </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">are within 500 feet of each other, and if the pilot of your </span><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;\">ship has Matched Speed with the other. When you do so,</span><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;\">any number of crew members or passengers can join a </span><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;\">boarding party. The umbilicus only remains attached as long as both ships remain within 500 feet of each other.</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 197\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">A boarding party and any hostile crew roll their own </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">initiative which acts parallel to ongoing ship combat. Combat as a boarding party is the same as normal combat. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">The boarding party arrives in a room via the umbilicus </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">and can only return to their own ship through the </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">umbilicus. The captain or engineer of the opposing ship </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">can disengage life support (or choose to only deactivate gravity, atmosphere, or heat) or start a self-destruct timer </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">on the ship. Additionally, if the boarding party accesses </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">important locations, such as the engine room, the shield generator, or a battle station housing a ship weapon, they </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">can use the opportunity to destroy or disable the ship's various systems and weapons. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">If the party eliminates all hostile crew members of the </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">boarded ship, they can commandeer it, provided that they </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">have a knowledgeable pilot and enough crew to operate it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13.000000pt; font-family: 'MrsEavesSmallCaps'; color: rgb(6.200000%, 6.600000%, 16.800000%);\">NPC Ships </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">The GM doesn't play the individual roles of an NPC ship separately. Rather, each NPC ship rolls its own initiative and can perform all its relevant actions on its turn. In </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">addition, rather than calculating the statistics of gunners, </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">NPC ships use the attack bonuses included in weapon entries and typically have one gunner at each weapon. The GM also decides the relevant ability checks and saving throws for NPC crewmen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">If an NPC ship has a Captain role, the GM can also allow the ship to take an additional action on its turn. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">Most GMs have NPC ships immediately explode when dropping to 0 hit points. Common exceptions </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">include when one or more player characters has boarded </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">the ship, or when an important NPC or villain is aboard it. Alternatively, the GM can rule that the characters in question escape aboard a life pod or a shuttle shortly before the ship&rsquo;s explosion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13.000000pt; font-family: 'MrsEavesSmallCaps'; color: rgb(6.200000%, 6.600000%, 16.800000%);\">Variant Rule: Grid Combat </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">Ship combat is particularly well-suited to using miniatures on a square-based grid map. Using this rule, each square is 500 feet by 500 feet and each ship faces the side or the corner of their surrounding squares. Ships of Transport size or smaller fit within a single square. On its turn, a ship moves 1 square for every 500 feet of its movement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">When counting distance on a grid, the first diagonal square counts as 1 square of movement, and the second diagonal square as 2 squares. Repeat this pattern of 1 square, 2 squares whenever you count diagonally, even if you move horizontally or vertically between different bits of movement.</span></p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 198\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13.000000pt; font-family: 'MrsEavesSmallCaps'; color: rgb(6.200000%, 6.600000%, 16.800000%);\">Variant Rule: Planes of Movement </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">Though ship combat primarily takes place on a 2D plane, </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">you can use this variant rule to convert combat into a </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">semblance of 3D space. When combat begins, the GM </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">decides how many </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPS'; font-weight: bold;\">Planes of Movement </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';\">exist.
