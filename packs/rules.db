The Captain, Dogfighter, and Engineer roles are optional; a captain provides extra actions to the crew, the engineer manages power flow and shields, and a dogfighter detaches from the main ship to target the weak points on enemy craft.</p>\n<h2>Initiative</h2>\n<p>When ship combat begins, each character must take a role on the ship to participate. A character's actions with regards to the ship are limited to the role they choose. Entire enemy ships act on a single turn of the initiative order, whereas individual characters act separately. However, if a character is in the role of the Captain, the entire crew can act on a single turn of the initiative order.</p>\n<h2>Character Roles</h2>\n<p>Each character on a starship chooses one of the following roles when they roll initiative. Depending on the ship, some roles, such as Gunner, might be occupied by one character, more than one character, or might not exist at all. By contrast, roles like Pilot are usually occupied only by one character.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A character can switch roles with another character or can switch to an unoccupied role as an action.</p>\n<h3>Captain</h3>\n<p>As the captain, you direct the ship's operations and manage the crew. If you choose to be the captain when the ship rolls initiative, you roll initiative for the entire ship. The entire party acts on that turn in the initiative order while you are captain, and you can choose in which order the crew members take their turns. If you leave the Captain role or fall unconscious, the party rolls initiative separately at the end of the next initiative order.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a captain, you can use the following actions:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Boarding Party</em></strong>. When the conditions for Boarding are met, you can use your action as the captain to form a boarding party (which you can choose to be a part of) and deploy the umbilicus.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong><em>Brace for Impact</em></strong>. You can use your action to brace the ship for damage. Each time your ship takes damage before the beginning of your next turn, you can roll 1d6 and subtract the number rolled from the mega damage your ship takes, to a minimum of 1.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div title=\"Page 194\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Deep Scan</strong></em>. If your ship is equipped with sensors, you can use your action to order a deep scan of a specific object of interest within range of the sensors. This allows you to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check to examine that object.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Fire at Will</strong></em>. You use your action to declare a barrage. One gunner of your choice can then use its reaction to make one attack with a ship weapon.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Full Speed Ahead</strong></em>. You use your action to push the engines. The pilot can then use its reaction to move the ship half its movement within the cone of movement.</p>\n<h3>Dogfighter</h3>\n<p>You deploy in a lighter, more maneuverable vessel to disable enemy fighters and target the vital locations of hostile ships. You can use your action to launch your fighter-sized ship from the main ship or to dock with it while you are adjacent to it. You can only switch roles while your fighter is docked with the main ship.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once launched, you can move your fighter's entire speed on its turn and use your action to fire its weapons. Movement and weapon attacks follow the same rules<br />as the Pilot&rsquo;s Move action and the Gunner&rsquo;s Open Fire action, except that moving your fighter doesn't require an action. You can also take the Pilot&rsquo;s Dogfighting action.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your fighter drops to 0 hit points and is destroyed, you can use your reaction to eject from the craft in a life pod to survive the explosion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While acting as a dogfighter, you can take the following special action:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Targeted Attack</strong></em>. While you are within 1,000 feet of another ship, you can use your action to attempt to disable one of that ship&rsquo;s systems. When you do so, make an attack targeting the ship with disadvantage. On a hit, you deal damage directly to a system of your choice, a weapon of your choice, or the ship&rsquo;s impulse engines. If the attack is blocked by a shield, the damage is subtracted from the target ship&rsquo;s shield points before it damages any system. Systems, weapons, and engines have 10 mega hit points each. Damage to systems is also deducted from the target ship&rsquo;s hit points.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a system or weapon drops to 0 hit points, it is disabled. Any creature operating a weapon when it is destroyed takes normal damage (as opposed to mega damage) equal to the damage dealt. If the engines drop to 0 hit points, the ship is crippled and can only move at half speed.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><img src=\"test.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"639\" height=\"365\" />&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Engineer</p>\n<p>As the engineer, you can direct power around the ship and position the ship's directional shield. By default, the shield is forward-facing and active.</p>\n<p>The ship's shield covers only one of the ship's four sides. As a bonus action, you can switch the direction the shield faces. If an attack hits the ship on its shielded side, damage is subtracted from the ship's shield points, rather than its hit points.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the initiative order, the shield regains half its maximum shield points, rounded up.</p>\n<p>As an engineer, you have the following actions available to you:</p>\n<p>Directing Power. You can use your action to deactivate the shield and direct its power elsewhere: either to the impulse engines or into one of the ship&rsquo;s weapons. If you invest the power in the ship&rsquo;s engines, the ship&rsquo;s movement speed increases by half until the beginning of your next turn. If you invest the power in one of the ship&rsquo;s weapons, a gunner can make one additional attack using that weapon when they take the Open Fire action.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can draw power from the ship&rsquo;s weapons and invest it in the ship's shields. When you do so, until the beginning of your next turn, the ship's shields&nbsp;cover two of its consecutive sides, instead of only one, and it regains all of its shield points at the beginning of the initiative order, instead of only half. In exchange, each gunner makes one weapon attack fewer than normal when they take the Open Fire action.</p>\n<div title=\"Page 195\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Overcharge. If you are a spellcaster, you can use your action to expend a spell slot with a level greater than or equal to the Dark Matter engine's class to overcharge the engine. The shield recharges completely, and until the beginning of your next turn, power is invested in the ship&rsquo;s engines (increasing the ship&rsquo;s movement speed by half) and every gun (allowing each gunner to make one additional attack using that weapon when they take the Open Fire action on their turn). Once you use this ability, you can&rsquo;t use it again for 1 minute.</p>\n<p>System Repair. You can use your action to repair a ship system or weapon that has 0 hit points and is deactivated. When you do so, make a DC 15 Intelligence (Technology) check. On a success, the system or weapon regains 1 mega hit point and reactivates at the beginning of your next turn.</p>\n<p>Void Jump. You can begin the charging process for a void jump. Once a Dark Matter engine has begun to charge, it will jump in 1 minute. No intervention can stop or slow this process; once it is begun, nothing short of destroying the ship can interrupt the jump. The pilot is responsible for guiding the ship on the jump itself and rolls on the Jump Navigation table when the jump begins.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div title=\"Page 196\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Gunner&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div title=\"Page 194\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div title=\"Page 196\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Acquiring targets and calculating ranges, you fire the shipboard weapons on hostile targets. Many ship weapons don't have any facing rules, but those which do are normally mounted to the front or to one of the sides of the ship. If a weapon has the Facing property, it can only be fired in a 90-degree cone in the direction in which it was mounted.</p>\n<p>While you are in the Gunner role, you can only operate one of the ship&rsquo;s weapons at a time. You can use a bonus action on your turn to switch between weapons.</p>\n<p>You add your proficiency bonus and Dexterity modifier to an attack roll you make with a ship&rsquo;s weapon, but you don't add any ability modifier to the weapon&rsquo;s damage rolls. Weapon entries in the Example Ships section include an example attack bonus, to be used only if the GM controls the ship as an NPC.</p>\n<p>As a gunner, you can take the following actions:</p>\n<p>Open Fire. You can take the Attack action on your turn to attack with one of the ship&rsquo;s weapons. You can make multiple attacks with this weapon if you have a feature, such as Extra Attack, that gives you extra attacks.</p>\n<p>Readied Attacks. You can use your action to ready an attack with a ship&rsquo;s weapon, just as you would ready an attack with a normal weapon. Often, this readied action is used to target deployed weapons, such as neutron torpedoes, the moment they are launched, or to strike another ship the moment it opens fire.</p>\n<p>Pilot</p>\n<p>As the pilot, you navigate and direct the ship's movement. Each ship has a given speed in hundreds of feet per turn, and a maneuverability score, which is given in degrees. Additionally, each ship faces a particular direction, which is normally in 45-degree intervals, and can be approximated using the eight cardinal directions.</p>\n<p>To approximate momentum, each ship's movement is limited to a cone of movement, which extends in the direction your ship is facing and is as wide as the ship&rsquo;s Maneuverability score, measured in degrees.</p>\n<p>As the ship&rsquo;s pilot, you can use the following special actions:</p>\n<p>Move. You use your action to move the ship up to its speed within the ship&rsquo;s cone of movement. Once you have finished moving, you can rotate the direction your ship is facing by up to its maneuverability score.</p>\n<p>Evasive Maneuvers. If your ship is Corvette-sized or smaller, you can use your action to perform evasive maneuvers instead of moving normally. When you do&nbsp;so, until the beginning of your next turn, you add your Dexterity modifier to the ship's AC and have advantage on Dexterity saving throws you make on behalf of the ship.</p>\n<div title=\"Page 196\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Dogfighting. If your ship is Corvette-sized or smaller and a ship of the same size classification is behind you within 1,000 feet, you can use your action to perform a complex maneuver. Make a Dexterity (Piloting) check, contested by the other ship. On a success, following several tight turns, you switch places with that ship. The direction both ships face remains the same.</p>\n<p>Hard Turn. If your ship is Corvette-sized or smaller, you can use your action to pull a hard turn, rotating your ship almost on the spot. You move your ship 500 feet in any direction and rotate to face any way you choose.</p>\n<p>Match Speed. Your ship attempts to move at the same rate and direction as another ship instead of moving normally. Choose one ship that you can see. Until the beginning of your next turn, your ship moves when that ship does and attempts to maintain the same distance from it and angle to it. If the target ship moves faster, is more maneuverable, or uses Hard Turn to perform a movement you are not normally capable of, this effect ends.</p>\n<p>Ram. If your ship is Frigate-sized or smaller (and you feel particularly foolhardy), you can ram your ship directly into a target by moving up to your speed within your cone of movement and entering a ship or mega creature&rsquo;s space. Your ship and the target each take 2d10 mega bludgeoning damage. Larger ships deal and take more damage in a ram: Transport ships deal 3d10, Corvettes and Frigates deal 4d10.</p>\n<p>Damage and Repair</p>\n<p>A ship&rsquo;s hit points are given in mega points and ship- based weapons usually deal damage in mega points as well. Optionally, the GM can rule that non-mega damage can&rsquo;t affect things which have mega hit points, and that mega damage is instantly lethal to non-mega targets.</p>\n<p>When a ship takes hit point damage, it represents structural damage to its hull which is not easily repaired. The loss of hit points has no effect on a ship&rsquo;s capabilities until the ship drops to 0 hit points. Individual systems and weapons, however, can be disabled by precision strikes, which is separate from normal hit point damage.</p>\n<p>Ships are immune to poison and psychic damage.</p>\n<p>Shield Points. If a ship has a shield generator, hit<br />point damage might instead be subtracted from the ship&rsquo;s shield points (SP), which are measured in mega hit points. Shields only cover a part of a ship, normally only one side. If the shortest line from an attacker to a shielded ship lands on a shielded side (or a corner of a shielded side), damage is subtracted from the ship's shield points, rather&nbsp;than its hit points. If an attack reduces the shield to 0 shield points, any excess damage carries over to hit points.</p>\n<div title=\"Page 197\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>A ship with a shield regains half its maximum shield points, rounded up, at the beginning of the engineer&rsquo;s turn (or the start of the initiative order, if the ship has no engineer).</p>\n<p>Destruction</p>\n<p>When a ship drops to 0 hit points, it becomes a blazing wreck. All of its systems, including weapons, engines, and life support, cease to function, and it can&rsquo;t regain hit points. Escape craft, like fighters, life pods, and shuttles can still eject from a blazing wreck. The ship is on a tipping point of complete disaster; it might soon explode outright, or otherwise become a derelict wreck.</p>\n<p>Explosion Saving Throws. If the ship is a blazing wreck at the end of the initiative order, one character makes a unique saving throw, called an explosion saving throw. This saving throw isn&rsquo;t tied to any ability score; it is purely dependent on chance.</p>\n<p>Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, the ship becomes a derelict wreck; it is adrift, and all its systems are still disabled, but it is no longer at risk of exploding and can, with extensive efforts, be repaired. On your third failure, the ship explodes, immediately killing any creatures still onboard. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind.</p>\n<p>Damage at 0 Hit Points. If your ship takes any damage while it is a blazing wreck, it suffers an explosion saving throw failure.</p>\n<p>Repair</p>\n<p>Repairing a ship is a difficult process requiring many hours of work. During your downtime, you can perform repairs on your ship. For each day you spend performing repairs, you make a DC 15 Intelligence (Technology) check. If you have proficiency in ship maintenance tools, you can add your proficiency bonus to the check, or double your proficiency bonus if you are also proficient with Technology. On a success, the ship regains mega hit points equal to your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. Alternatively, the ship can be repaired completely in one day at port for a fee of 2 gp per mega hit point lost.</p>\n<p>Boarding</p>\n<p>Sometimes, your objective in ship-to-ship combat requires that you come aboard a hostile vessel. You can board another vessel if your ship has an umbilicus, if both ships are within 500 feet of each other, and if the pilot of your ship has Matched Speed with the other. When you do so,&nbsp;any number of crew members or passengers can join a boarding party. The umbilicus only remains attached as long as both ships remain within 500 feet of each other.</p>\n<div title=\"Page 197\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>A boarding party and any hostile crew roll their own initiative which acts parallel to ongoing ship combat. Combat as a boarding party is the same as normal combat.</p>\n<p>The boarding party arrives in a room via the umbilicus and can only return to their own ship through the umbilicus. The captain or engineer of the opposing ship can disengage life support (or choose to only deactivate gravity, atmosphere, or heat) or start a self-destruct timer on the ship. Additionally, if the boarding party accesses important locations, such as the engine room, the shield generator, or a battle station housing a ship weapon, they can use the opportunity to destroy or disable the ship's various systems and weapons.</p>\n<p>If the party eliminates all hostile crew members of the boarded ship, they can commandeer it, provided that they have a knowledgeable pilot and enough crew to operate it.</p>\n<p>NPC Ships</p>\n<p>The GM doesn't play the individual roles of an NPC ship separately. Rather, each NPC ship rolls its own initiative and can perform all its relevant actions on its turn. In addition, rather than calculating the statistics of gunners, NPC ships use the attack bonuses included in weapon entries and typically have one gunner at each weapon. The GM also decides the relevant ability checks and saving throws for NPC crewmen.</p>\n<p>If an NPC ship has a Captain role, the GM can also allow the ship to take an additional action on its turn.</p>\n<p>Most GMs have NPC ships immediately explode when dropping to 0 hit points. Common exceptions include when one or more player characters has boarded the ship, or when an important NPC or villain is aboard it. Alternatively, the GM can rule that the characters in question escape aboard a life pod or a shuttle shortly before the ship&rsquo;s explosion.</p>\n<p>Variant Rule: Grid Combat</p>\n<p>Ship combat is particularly well-suited to using miniatures on a square-based grid map. Using this rule, each square is 500 feet by 500 feet and each ship faces the side or the corner of their surrounding squares. Ships of Transport size or smaller fit within a single square. On its turn, a ship moves 1 square for every 500 feet of its movement.</p>\n<p>When counting distance on a grid, the first diagonal square counts as 1 square of movement, and the second diagonal square as 2 squares. Repeat this pattern of 1 square, 2 squares whenever you count diagonally, even if you move horizontally or vertically between different bits of movement.</p>\n<div title=\"Page 198\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Variant Rule: Planes of Movement</p>\n<p>Though ship combat primarily takes place on a 2D plane, you can use this variant rule to convert combat into a semblance of 3D space. When combat begins, the GM decides how many Planes of Movement exist. In open space, there might be three to four, while in orbit around a star, there may only be two.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>When moving your ship, you can expend 1,000 feet of movement to move up or down one Plane of Movement (doing so also moves you 500 feet forward in your cone of movement). When you target ships in other planes of movement, they are treated as being an additional 500 feet away for each plane of movement between your ship and the target. Two ships can pass above or below one another in the same space while in different planes of movement.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/ship-combat-quote.png"}

Additionally, each ship faces a particular direction, which is normally in 45-degree intervals, and can be approximated using the eight cardinal directions.</p>\n<p>To approximate momentum, each ship's movement is limited to a cone of movement, which extends in the direction your ship is facing and is as wide as the ship&rsquo;s Maneuverability score, measured in degrees.</p>\n<p>As the ship&rsquo;s pilot, you can use the following special actions:</p>\n<p>Move. You use your action to move the ship up to its speed within the ship&rsquo;s cone of movement. Once you have finished moving, you can rotate the direction your ship is facing by up to its maneuverability score.</p>\n<p>Evasive Maneuvers. If your ship is Corvette-sized or smaller, you can use your action to perform evasive maneuvers instead of moving normally. When you do&nbsp;so, until the beginning of your next turn, you add your Dexterity modifier to the ship's AC and have advantage on Dexterity saving throws you make on behalf of the ship.</p>\n<div title=\"Page 196\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Dogfighting. If your ship is Corvette-sized or smaller and a ship of the same size classification is behind you within 1,000 feet, you can use your action to perform a complex maneuver. Make a Dexterity (Piloting) check, contested by the other ship. On a success, following several tight turns, you switch places with that ship. The direction both ships face remains the same.</p>\n<p>Hard Turn. If your ship is Corvette-sized or smaller, you can use your action to pull a hard turn, rotating your ship almost on the spot. You move your ship 500 feet in any direction and rotate to face any way you choose.</p>\n<p>Match Speed. Your ship attempts to move at the same rate and direction as another ship instead of moving normally. Choose one ship that you can see. Until the beginning of your next turn, your ship moves when that ship does and attempts to maintain the same distance from it and angle to it. If the target ship moves faster, is more maneuverable, or uses Hard Turn to perform a movement you are not normally capable of, this effect ends.</p>\n<p>Ram. If your ship is Frigate-sized or smaller (and you feel particularly foolhardy), you can ram your ship directly into a target by moving up to your speed within your cone of movement and entering a ship or mega creature&rsquo;s space. Your ship and the target each take 2d10 mega bludgeoning damage. Larger ships deal and take more damage in a ram: Transport ships deal 3d10, Corvettes and Frigates deal 4d10.</p>\n<p>Damage and Repair</p>\n<p>A ship&rsquo;s hit points are given in mega points and ship- based weapons usually deal damage in mega points as well. Optionally, the GM can rule that non-mega damage can&rsquo;t affect things which have mega hit points, and that mega damage is instantly lethal to non-mega targets.</p>\n<p>When a ship takes hit point damage, it represents structural damage to its hull which is not easily repaired. The loss of hit points has no effect on a ship&rsquo;s capabilities until the ship drops to 0 hit points. Individual systems and weapons, however, can be disabled by precision strikes, which is separate from normal hit point damage.</p>\n<p>Ships are immune to poison and psychic damage.</p>\n<p>Shield Points. If a ship has a shield generator, hit<br />point damage might instead be subtracted from the ship&rsquo;s shield points (SP), which are measured in mega hit points. Shields only cover a part of a ship, normally only one side. If the shortest line from an attacker to a shielded ship lands on a shielded side (or a corner of a shielded side), damage is subtracted from the ship's shield points, rather&nbsp;than its hit points. If an attack reduces the shield to 0 shield points, any excess damage carries over to hit points.</p>\n<div title=\"Page 197\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>A ship with a shield regains half its maximum shield points, rounded up, at the beginning of the engineer&rsquo;s turn (or the start of the initiative order, if the ship has no engineer).</p>\n<p>Destruction</p>\n<p>When a ship drops to 0 hit points, it becomes a blazing wreck. All of its systems, including weapons, engines, and life support, cease to function, and it can&rsquo;t regain hit points. Escape craft, like fighters, life pods, and shuttles can still eject from a blazing wreck. The ship is on a tipping point of complete disaster; it might soon explode outright, or otherwise become a derelict wreck.</p>\n<p>Explosion Saving Throws. If the ship is a blazing wreck at the end of the initiative order, one character makes a unique saving throw, called an explosion saving throw. This saving throw isn&rsquo;t tied to any ability score; it is purely dependent on chance.</p>\n<p>Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, the ship becomes a derelict wreck; it is adrift, and all its systems are still disabled, but it is no longer at risk of exploding and can, with extensive efforts, be repaired. On your third failure, the ship explodes, immediately killing any creatures still onboard. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind.</p>\n<p>Damage at 0 Hit Points. If your ship takes any damage while it is a blazing wreck, it suffers an explosion saving throw failure.</p>\n<p>Repair</p>\n<p>Repairing a ship is a difficult process requiring many hours of work. During your downtime, you can perform repairs on your ship. For each day you spend performing repairs, you make a DC 15 Intelligence (Technology) check. If you have proficiency in ship maintenance tools, you can add your proficiency bonus to the check, or double your proficiency bonus if you are also proficient with Technology. On a success, the ship regains mega hit points equal to your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. Alternatively, the ship can be repaired completely in one day at port for a fee of 2 gp per mega hit point lost.</p>\n<p>Boarding</p>\n<p>Sometimes, your objective in ship-to-ship combat requires that you come aboard a hostile vessel. You can board another vessel if your ship has an umbilicus, if both ships are within 500 feet of each other, and if the pilot of your ship has Matched Speed with the other. When you do so,&nbsp;any number of crew members or passengers can join a boarding party. The umbilicus only remains attached as long as both ships remain within 500 feet of each other.</p>\n<div title=\"Page 197\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>A boarding party and any hostile crew roll their own initiative which acts parallel to ongoing ship combat. Combat as a boarding party is the same as normal combat.</p>\n<p>The boarding party arrives in a room via the umbilicus and can only return to their own ship through the umbilicus. The captain or engineer of the opposing ship can disengage life support (or choose to only deactivate gravity, atmosphere, or heat) or start a self-destruct timer on the ship. Additionally, if the boarding party accesses important locations, such as the engine room, the shield generator, or a battle station housing a ship weapon, they can use the opportunity to destroy or disable the ship's various systems and weapons.</p>\n<p>If the party eliminates all hostile crew members of the boarded ship, they can commandeer it, provided that they have a knowledgeable pilot and enough crew to operate it.</p>\n<p>NPC Ships</p>\n<p>The GM doesn't play the individual roles of an NPC ship separately. Rather, each NPC ship rolls its own initiative and can perform all its relevant actions on its turn. In addition, rather than calculating the statistics of gunners, NPC ships use the attack bonuses included in weapon entries and typically have one gunner at each weapon. The GM also decides the relevant ability checks and saving throws for NPC crewmen.</p>\n<p>If an NPC ship has a Captain role, the GM can also allow the ship to take an additional action on its turn.</p>\n<p>Most GMs have NPC ships immediately explode when dropping to 0 hit points. Common exceptions include when one or more player characters has boarded the ship, or when an important NPC or villain is aboard it. Alternatively, the GM can rule that the characters in question escape aboard a life pod or a shuttle shortly before the ship&rsquo;s explosion.</p>\n<p>Variant Rule: Grid Combat</p>\n<p>Ship combat is particularly well-suited to using miniatures on a square-based grid map. Using this rule, each square is 500 feet by 500 feet and each ship faces the side or the corner of their surrounding squares. Ships of Transport size or smaller fit within a single square. On its turn, a ship moves 1 square for every 500 feet of its movement.</p>\n<p>When counting distance on a grid, the first diagonal square counts as 1 square of movement, and the second diagonal square as 2 squares. Repeat this pattern of 1 square, 2 squares whenever you count diagonally, even if you move horizontally or vertically between different bits of movement.</p>\n<div title=\"Page 198\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Variant Rule: Planes of Movement</p>\n<p>Though ship combat primarily takes place on a 2D plane, you can use this variant rule to convert combat into a semblance of 3D space. When combat begins, the GM decides how many Planes of Movement exist. In open space, there might be three to four, while in orbit around a star, there may only be two.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>When moving your ship, you can expend 1,000 feet of movement to move up or down one Plane of Movement (doing so also moves you 500 feet forward in your cone of movement). When you target ships in other planes of movement, they are treated as being an additional 500 feet away for each plane of movement between your ship and the target. Two ships can pass above or below one another in the same space while in different planes of movement.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/ship-combat-quote.png"}
{"_id":"d9zO8QLjeP8S1Uhu","name":"DM Chapter 6: Ships - Ship Combat","permission":{"default":0,"aRO6UflmDLJFZem6":3},"folder":"","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.oTqHu3oEMVnxJMZ7"}},"content":"<div title=\"Page 194\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h1>Ship Combat</h1>\n<p>Combat between starships is a deadly and unforgiving game, for the loser is subjected to the lifeless, infinite void of space.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ship combat follows most of the same rules and conventions as ordinary combat; for example, ships follow an initiative order and generally play on a 2D plane.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ship movement is covered in the Pilot role and ship attacks are covered in the Gunner role. The Captain, Dogfighter, and Engineer roles are optional; a captain provides extra actions to the crew, the engineer manages power flow and shields, and a dogfighter detaches from the main ship to target the weak points on enemy craft.</p>\n<h2>Initiative</h2>\n<p>When ship combat begins, each character must take a role on the ship to participate. A character's actions with regards to the ship are limited to the role they choose. Entire enemy ships act on a single turn of the initiative order, whereas individual characters act separately. However, if a character is in the role of the Captain, the entire crew can act on a single turn of the initiative order.</p>\n<h2>Character Roles</h2>\n<p>Each character on a starship chooses one of the following roles when they roll initiative. Depending on the ship, some roles, such as Gunner, might be occupied by one character, more than one character, or might not exist at all. By contrast, roles like Pilot are usually occupied only by one character.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A character can switch roles with another character or can switch to an unoccupied role as an action.</p>\n<h3>Captain</h3>\n<p>As the captain, you direct the ship's operations and manage the crew. If you choose to be the captain when the ship rolls initiative, you roll initiative for the entire ship. The entire party acts on that turn in the initiative order while you are captain, and you can choose in which order the crew members take their turns. If you leave the Captain role or fall unconscious, the party rolls initiative separately at the end of the next initiative order.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a captain, you can use the following actions:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Boarding Party</em></strong>. When the conditions for Boarding are met, you can use your action as the captain to form a boarding party (which you can choose to be a part of) and deploy the umbilicus.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong><em>Brace for Impact</em></strong>. You can use your action to brace the ship for damage. Each time your ship takes damage before the beginning of your next turn, you can roll 1d6 and subtract the number rolled from the mega damage your ship takes, to a minimum of 1.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div title=\"Page 194\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Deep Scan</strong></em>. If your ship is equipped with sensors, you can use your action to order a deep scan of a specific object of interest within range of the sensors. This allows you to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check to examine that object.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Fire at Will</strong></em>. You use your action to declare a barrage. One gunner of your choice can then use its reaction to make one attack with a ship weapon.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Full Speed Ahead</strong></em>. You use your action to push the engines. The pilot can then use its reaction to move the ship half its movement within the cone of movement.</p>\n<h3>Dogfighter</h3>\n<p>You deploy in a lighter, more maneuverable vessel to disable enemy fighters and target the vital locations of hostile ships. You can use your action to launch your fighter-sized ship from the main ship or to dock with it while you are adjacent to it. You can only switch roles while your fighter is docked with the main ship.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once launched, you can move your fighter's entire speed on its turn and use your action to fire its weapons. Movement and weapon attacks follow the same rules<br />as the Pilot&rsquo;s Move action and the Gunner&rsquo;s Open Fire action, except that moving your fighter doesn't require an action. You can also take the Pilot&rsquo;s Dogfighting action.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your fighter drops to 0 hit points and is destroyed, you can use your reaction to eject from the craft in a life pod to survive the explosion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While acting as a dogfighter, you can take the following special action:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Targeted Attack</strong></em>. While you are within 1,000 feet of another ship, you can use your action to attempt to disable one of that ship&rsquo;s systems. When you do so, make an attack targeting the ship with disadvantage. On a hit, you deal damage directly to a system of your choice, a weapon of your choice, or the ship&rsquo;s impulse engines. If the attack is blocked by a shield, the damage is subtracted from the target ship&rsquo;s shield points before it damages any system. Systems, weapons, and engines have 10 mega hit points each. Damage to systems is also deducted from the target ship&rsquo;s hit points.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a system or weapon drops to 0 hit points, it is disabled. Any creature operating a weapon when it is destroyed takes normal damage (as opposed to mega damage) equal to the damage dealt. If the engines drop to 0 hit points, the ship is crippled and can only move at half speed.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><img src=\"test.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"639\" height=\"365\" />&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Engineer</p>\n<p>As the engineer, you can direct power around the ship and position the ship's directional shield. By default, the shield is forward-facing and active.</p>\n<p>The ship's shield covers only one of the ship's four sides. As a bonus action, you can switch the direction the shield faces. If an attack hits the ship on its shielded side, damage is subtracted from the ship's shield points, rather than its hit points.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the initiative order, the shield regains half its maximum shield points, rounded up.</p>\n<p>As an engineer, you have the following actions available to you:</p>\n<p>Directing Power. You can use your action to deactivate the shield and direct its power elsewhere: either to the impulse engines or into one of the ship&rsquo;s weapons. If you invest the power in the ship&rsquo;s engines, the ship&rsquo;s movement speed increases by half until the beginning of your next turn. If you invest the power in one of the ship&rsquo;s weapons, a gunner can make one additional attack using that weapon when they take the Open Fire action.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can draw power from the ship&rsquo;s weapons and invest it in the ship's shields. When you do so, until the beginning of your next turn, the ship's shields&nbsp;cover two of its consecutive sides, instead of only one, and it regains all of its shield points at the beginning of the initiative order, instead of only half. In exchange, each gunner makes one weapon attack fewer than normal when they take the Open Fire action.</p>\n<div title=\"Page 195\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Overcharge. If you are a spellcaster, you can use your action to expend a spell slot with a level greater than or equal to the Dark Matter engine's class to overcharge the engine. The shield recharges completely, and until the beginning of your next turn, power is invested in the ship&rsquo;s engines (increasing the ship&rsquo;s movement speed by half) and every gun (allowing each gunner to make one additional attack using that weapon when they take the Open Fire action on their turn). Once you use this ability, you can&rsquo;t use it again for 1 minute.</p>\n<p>System Repair. You can use your action to repair a ship system or weapon that has 0 hit points and is deactivated. When you do so, make a DC 15 Intelligence (Technology) check. On a success, the system or weapon regains 1 mega hit point and reactivates at the beginning of your next turn.</p>\n<p>Void Jump. You can begin the charging process for a void jump. Once a Dark Matter engine has begun to charge, it will jump in 1 minute. No intervention can stop or slow this process; once it is begun, nothing short of destroying the ship can interrupt the jump. The pilot is responsible for guiding the ship on the jump itself and rolls on the Jump Navigation table when the jump begins.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div title=\"Page 196\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Gunner&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div title=\"Page 194\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div title=\"Page 196\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Acquiring targets and calculating ranges, you fire the shipboard weapons on hostile targets. Many ship weapons don't have any facing rules, but those which do are normally mounted to the front or to one of the sides of the ship. If a weapon has the Facing property, it can only be fired in a 90-degree cone in the direction in which it was mounted.</p>\n<p>While you are in the Gunner role, you can only operate one of the ship&rsquo;s weapons at a time. You can use a bonus action on your turn to switch between weapons.</p>\n<p>You add your proficiency bonus and Dexterity modifier to an attack roll you make with a ship&rsquo;s weapon, but you don't add any ability modifier to the weapon&rsquo;s damage rolls. Weapon entries in the Example Ships section include an example attack bonus, to be used only if the GM controls the ship as an NPC.</p>\n<p>As a gunner, you can take the following actions:</p>\n<p>Open Fire. You can take the Attack action on your turn to attack with one of the ship&rsquo;s weapons. You can make multiple attacks with this weapon if you have a feature, such as Extra Attack, that gives you extra attacks.</p>\n<p>Readied Attacks. You can use your action to ready an attack with a ship&rsquo;s weapon, just as you would ready an attack with a normal weapon. Often, this readied action is used to target deployed weapons, such as neutron torpedoes, the moment they are launched, or to strike another ship the moment it opens fire.</p>\n<p>Pilot</p>\n<p>As the pilot, you navigate and direct the ship's movement.

{"name":"DM Chapter 6: Ships","permission":{"default":0,"PmXouJxFyK2lSXOA":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.iCXBxw5Gxhi8tcNp"}},"content":"<h1>Chapter 6: Ships<img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/ship-pg157.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"25%\" height=\"25%\" /></h1>\n<p>Be it for planet-hopping exploration, high-stakes smuggling, or white-knuckle dogfighting, no campaign in <em>Dark Matter</em> is complete without a starship. This chapter details how to use Dark Matter engines, ship statistics, crew roles, ship combat, and space exploration. Additionally, it includes a plethora of ship options.</p>\n<h2>Ship Traits</h2>\n<p>The common saying goes: \"No two ships in the 'verse are alike.\" Though any mechanic will tell you that this isn't exactly true, the meld of magic and technology spacefaring vessels employ to cross the gulfs of space vary in thousands of ways. Even ships laid down in the same yard to the same specification are likely to go through multiple refits, overhauls, and repairs during their lives, leaving them unrecognizable after a few years in the Black. For most purposes, ships are described by statistics which include the following information:</p>\n<p>Size classification, hit points, shield points, Armor Class, engines, systems, crew, cargo, cost, challenge, and<br />weapons, all of which are detailed below.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More details for how these statistics are used can be found in the Ship Combat section.</p>\n<h3>Size Classification</h3>\n<p>Ships are categorized according to their <strong>Size Classification</strong>, which generally determines other important aspects: its crew size, top speed outside of void jumps, maneuverability, and durability. For example, a larger ship might be able to carry more men and guns, but a smaller ship can outrun and outmaneuver it. Different size classifications are detailed in the Size Classification table below.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ships also mention which race generally builds that type of ship. This has no mechanical effect on its own; instead, it gives an impression about which types of creatures might be piloting them, and what statistics you can expect from that type of ship. For example, Hammers, which are dwarven fighters, are sturdily built, and possess a higher Armor Class than many other fighters as a result.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, the Ship Classification table indicates the size of a ship in feet and its size using the optional Grid Combat rules. The sizes listed are maximum sizes.</p>\n<h4>Character Level</h4>\n<p>A typical adventuring party might begin their adventures with a modest personal ship and invest in larger, more capable vessels as their fortunes grow. Larger parties, however, will find the cargo space and crew capacity of a transport ship essential. At very high levels, characters might enlist a crew to man a frigate or even an entire fleet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, a party&rsquo;s character level has no bearing on ship size (and by extension, ship combat power), but a GM can award a party with larger ships as they grow in level. As such, the Ship Classification table also includes a recommended character level for some ship sizes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"width: 638px;\" border=\"0\" width=\"426\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><colgroup><col style=\"width: 138.5px;\" width=\"93\" /> <col style=\"width: 161.5px;\" width=\"121\" /> <col style=\"width: 186.5px;\" width=\"143\" /> <col style=\"width: 148.5px;\" width=\"69\" /> </colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl65\" style=\"height: 15.0pt; mso-ignore: colspan; width: 161pt;\" colspan=\"2\" width=\"214\" height=\"20\">\n<h2><em>Dark Matter Ship Classifications</em></h2>\n</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 107pt;\" width=\"143\">\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n</td>\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"width: 52pt;\" width=\"69\">\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl68\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">\n<h3>Classification</h3>\n</td>\n<td class=\"xl69\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">\n<h3>Dimensions (feet)</h3>\n</td>\n<td class=\"xl69\" style=\"width: 107pt;\" width=\"143\">\n<h3>Dimensions (squares)</h3>\n</td>\n<td class=\"xl68\">\n<h3>Rec.

If you&rsquo;re not sure how to create new stats or how to interpret an effect happening at starship scale, remember that hit points and<br />damage (which use mega points), movement speed, and ship scale are generally scaled up by 100 times. This can provide a good rule of thumb when a quick decision is necessary at the table.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<h3>Armor Class</h3>\n<p>Like creatures and structures, ships have an Armor Class (AC). Unlike creatures, however, a ship&rsquo;s Armor Class is&nbsp;&nbsp; perfectly literal: it represents how heavily armored a ship is and determines how successful an attack is likely to be.</p>\n<h3>Mega Hit Points</h3>\n<p>The damage necessary to injure and kill the hardiest of men is paltry compared to the durability and lethality of&nbsp; an entire starship. Therefore, ships use Mega Hit Points, instead of regular hit points, to describe their damage and repair. A single mega hit point equals 100 hit points. A ship&rsquo;s hit points represent the resilience of its hull.</p>\n<h3>Shield Points</h3>\n<p>In addition to hit points, many ships have Shield Points, (expressed in mega points) which determine how much damage can be absorbed by the ship's shield. Shields are always created by a shield generator system and are controlled by the ship&rsquo;s engineer.</p>\n<h3>Engines</h3>\n<p>Ships generally have two Engine types, a Dark Matter engine to perform void jumps, and an Impulse engine, used to maneuver when not in the Void. Each impulse engine has a given Speed in hundreds of feet per turn and a Maneuverability score, measured in degrees, which determines a ship's cone of movement. More information about engines can be found in the Dark Matter Engines section, and more information about movement can be found in the Ship Combat section.</p>\n<h3>Systems</h3>\n<p>Everything from essentials, like a ship&rsquo;s life support or sensors, to peripheral functions, like tractor beams and teleporters are encapsulated in a ship&rsquo;s Systems. The list of systems available to a ship are detailed in the Systems section.</p>\n<h3>Crew</h3>\n<p>The ship's Crew indicates the roles that are available to characters in the ship. If a Dogfighter role is available, the entry in parentheses indicates the default type of ship that the dogfighters pilot. For more information on how to use the crew roles, see the Ship Combat section. Note that most ships will have room for passengers that won't actively take a role in ship combat.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the need arises, a ship can temporarily take on more passengers than it can safely support. Doing so taxes the life-support, however, and can only be performed for a short time. For each day that the ship is above its passenger capacity, every passenger onboard gains one level of exhaustion. These levels of exhaustion can&rsquo;t be removed by those aboard until the ship is once again below capacity.</p>\n<h3>Cargo</h3>\n<p>Each ship has a fixed Cargo capacity, which indicates the amount of cargo the ship can carry.</p>\n<h3>Cost</h3>\n<p>Most ships can be bought and sold at docks and starports throughout the &lsquo;verse, and therefore have an included Cost. This price is a typical figure for a ship of its type, but unscrupulous (or simply ignorant) merchants might sell ships for a far higher or far lower price.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not all ships have an included cost; the very largest and most powerful of ships are ostensibly priceless and are never bought or sold at market.</p>\n<h3>Challenge</h3>\n<p>Like monsters, ships have a Challenge rating to help GMs compose challenging encounters using them. When determining encounter difficulty, it is best to use the average of the party&rsquo;s level and their ship&rsquo;s challenge rating as the party&rsquo;s effective level.</p>\n<h3>Weapons</h3>\n<p>Ship-mounted weaponry comes in a bewildering variety of shapes and sizes, from physical battering rams, to extremely large flamethrowers, to deployable mines, but the most common ship-mounted Weapons are based on the same principles as handheld blasters. They are, nonetheless, singularly destructive, capable of melting clean through armored hulls in a single shot.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ship armaments are explained in the Ship Weapons section, with additional details on their use in the Ship Combat section.</p>\n<h2>Dark Matter Engines</h2>\n<p>Spacefaring vessels in the 'verse are abundant and varied, reflecting hundreds of societies and their diverse technologies. Nearly all of them operate via a Dark Matter engine, a solid or latticework crystal structure surrounded by heat sinks, stabilizers, and other supporting equipment. These engines are powered by magic, allowing them to carry a ship on short jumps through the Void to cross vast gulfs of space.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dark Matter engines are the hearts of starships. Most ships also have other engines, called impulse engines, to travel outside of void jumps, but a Dark Matter engine is required to embark on any planet-hopping adventure.</p>\n<h3>Engine Class</h3>\n<p>Dark Matter engines can only jump twice a day, and most can maintain a void jump for only a short time before needing time to cool down and recharge. Therefore, Dark Matter engines are organized into Classes, from 1 &ndash; 9, based upon the length of their jumps. These Classes are detailed in the Dark Matter Engine Classes table.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a spellcaster directly powers the engine using their magic, they can cause a Dark Matter engine to jump two more times on a given day. However, progressively more powerful engines require more arcane magic. A Class 1 engine can be powered by a 1st level spell slot, but a Class 2 engine requires a 2nd level spell slot, and so on.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Engines with the lowest classes are ostensibly systemhoppers, allowing a small starship to jump around a single system, or to go on longer journeys between nearby systems. Often, these types of ships will need to be carried within higher class starships to cross longer distances.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Class 10 engines are strictly theoretical or legendary, depending on who you ask. Such an engine could cross the galaxy in a single day, requiring no spellcasters of any sort, and would have to be the direct creation of the gods, or some ancient, mystical alien race.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"height: 175px;

Rare, fragile, and extracted from the Void at the event horizons of black holes, these crystals are among the most valuable and volatile materials in the 'verse. If a void crystal is damaged in the slightest, it risks not only becoming inoperable, but also collapsing into a <em>sphere of annihilation</em>, destroying the rest of the engine and the entire ship. Thus, most of the stabilizing equipment surrounding the core of a Dark Matter engine serves only to insulate and protect the crystal within.</p>\n<h3>Running a Dark Matter Engine</h3>\n<p>To many, it seems that Dark Matter engines are temperamental and perplexing without end, behaving like living things unto themselves. No single race&rsquo;s designs and no particular model accurately represents the variety of these engines; even engines of the same model act differently when fed different types of magical energy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a ship has long had a warlock working as an engineer, the Dark Matter engine may start to belch clouds of sulfur and brimstone, and charge faster when those aboard the ship are miserable. Wizards, on the other hand, keep rather tidy, if meticulously modified, engines, which are likely to pulse with rhythmic bursts of force when engaged in a jump. The variations are endless: engines run by illusionists chromatically aberrate the air around them, druid-kept engines sprout twigs and grass in their crevices, and some dwarven engines produce a small amount of beer as exhaust.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Charging a Dark Matter Engine</em></strong>. All Dark Matter engines, regardless of type, require significant energy to charge-up before a jump. Older or worn models of engine can take several hours of warm-up time, during which they must be fed a continuous stream of magical energy. In general, assume that an engine requires 1 minute of warm-up time prior to a jump.</p>\n<h2>Ship Weapons</h2>\n<p>Ship-mounted weapons are among the most lethal devices ever conceived. A direct shot with any of these massive weapons can vaporize an unprotected person, but no less is necessary to pierce the armored hull of a starship.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ship-mounted weapons are used by crewmen in the Gunner role. A character with martial weapons proficiency also has proficiency with ship weapons.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ship weapon damages are given in mega damage points.</p>\n<h3>Weapon Descriptions</h3>\n<p>These weapons are installed in ships across the &lsquo;verse, from amoeboid saucers to human warbringers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Auto Turret</em></strong>. This omni-directional twin blaster is fired from a swiveling, domed turret. Because of its rotating mount, the blaster is relatively small compared to other ship-mounted weapons, but it is capable of harrying other vessels from all angles.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Antimatter Mine</strong></em>. Antimatter mines are explosives designed to lay dormant until magnetically attracted to nearby targets. Each mine weighs around 1,000 pounds and are deployed from a launch tube, normally installed near a ship&rsquo;s cargo bay.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Heavy Cannon</strong></em>. Ballistic weapons are uncommon in space combat, but not totally unheard of (and certainly not ineffective). A heavy cannon fires large-diameter explosive shells, which unlike blaster bolts, must lead their target to account for travel time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Light Cannon</em></strong>. Scaled-down versions of heavy cannons, light cannons trade sheer firepower for a faster rate of fire, greater density of stored ammunition, and more flexibility in mounting positions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Lightning Coil</strong></em>. This enormous transformer draws a similarly large amount of power and generates arcs of lightning thousands of feet long. Because the lightning discharges toward any nearby target, the lightning coil is<br />actually omni-directional.</p>\n<p><em><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mining Laser</strong></em>. This laser and its turret deploy from a hatch on the ship, with a blast screen protecting it from loose debris. If allowed to focus on an immobile target, the laser grows hot enough to break chunks from solid asteroids.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Neutron Torpedo</strong></em>. This cigar-shaped missile carries a hefty neutron payload to its target. Unfortunately, the torpedo only carries a limited amount of fuel, limiting its maximum range.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Pulse Cannon</strong></em>. One of the staple fixed-position blasters, the pulse cannon charges an incredible burst of energy in a large capacitor bank, before releasing it in a brilliant flicker of light. This weapon owes its popularity to its balance of firepower and range.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Railgun</strong></em>. Conducting a ferromagnetic projectile down two conductive rails requires a frankly outrageous amount of power, but the results are hard to argue with. A railgun transfers so much kinetic energy into its projectile that it generally degrades into plasma en route to its target.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Scorcher</strong></em>. Scorchers spit a narrow fan of flame from their mouths, normally with the intent of melting through the hulls of other ships or making them malleable enough to warp. Because of this uncouth design, scorchers trade range for the singular ability to bypass shield systems.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Starbuster</em></strong>. Starbusters are the largest blasters ever fashioned. By channeling six component blasters into a single, mighty beam, this weapon can rend entire ships in half. Its scale and power consumption mean that only the grandest of ships can shoulder it; of course, this also means that this weapon is as useful for deterrence as it is for defense.</p>\n<h3>Ship Weapon Properties</h3>\n<p>In addition to weapon properties presented in the Equipment chapter, shipbound weapons have special properties that are unique to their use.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Deployable</strong></em>. A deployable weapon releases a type of ammunition that separates from the ship, which might have a movement speed of its own, noted in parentheses.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you make an attack using one of these weapons, you deploy the weapon within your ship&rsquo;s space. You make an attack roll using this weapon when it contacts another ship.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you use a deployable weapon that has a movement speed, you can choose the direction it travels as a bonus action on your turn. A deployable weapon has a maneuverability of 90 degrees and begins facing in the same direction as the ship. Once a deployable weapon moves for 3 turns, it deactivates and begins drifting listlessly.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deployable weapons can be targeted independently during flight. Each of these weapons has Armor Class 10<br />and 1 mega hit point.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Fixed</strong></em>. This weapon is mounted on one side of a ship and can only make attacks against targets within a 90-degree cone in the direction it is facing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Ship</strong></em>. A ship weapon is powered by a ship and must be mounted to one to fire. This weapon can&rsquo;t target any creature or object that is Huge or smaller.</p>\n<h3>Special Weapons</h3>\n<p>These ship weapons have special properties.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Antimatter Mine</strong></em>. If a ship other than your own with a Dark Matter engine comes within 1,000 feet of this mine, the mine detonates. When this happens, make an attack roll with the mine against the triggering ship.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Lightning Coil</strong></em>. This weapon deals double damage to shield points, but half damage (rounded down) to hit points. If this damage reduces a ship&rsquo;s shields points to 0, remaining damage is not subtracted from hit points.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Mining Laser</strong></em>. This weapon is designed to cut through immobile asteroids and other bodies of rock. It deals double damage to targets that have not moved in the last round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Scorcher</strong></em>. This weapon produces a scorching fan of arcane energy which heats a ship&rsquo;s hull without affecting its shields. Shields do not block this weapon's damage.</p>\n<h3>Ammunition and Deployable Weapons</h3>\n<p>Many ship weapons rely on blaster technology, which are powered strictly by the ship&rsquo;s Dark Matter engine, and don't require ammunition of any sort. Other ship weapons (especially those favored by gnomes) are more closely related to firearms in design and require ammunition, or deploy from the ship and fly independently, almost like separate vehicles. Ammunition and deployable weapons have independent costs and must be purchased separately.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"height: 295px;\" border=\"0\" width=\"659\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><colgroup><col style=\"width: 150px;\" width=\"115\" /><col style=\"width: 58px;\" width=\"121\" /><col style=\"width: 191px;\" width=\"143\" /><col style=\"width: 294px;\" width=\"280\" /></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 15px;\">\n<td class=\"xl68\" style=\"height: 15px;

This is called a broadside attack. When a ship makes a broadside attack, each mega creature and the pilot of each ship in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking full damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Broadside attacks require a gunner, much like other attacks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A broadside attack can only be used once on each round. If a broadside attack is disabled, it can still be used to make an attack, but deals only half damage on a failed saving throw, and no damage on a successful save.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A ship with broadside attacks can&rsquo;t replace them with other ship weapons.</p>\n<h3>Ship Melee Weapons</h3>\n<p>Some ships have tremendous built-in melee weapons, designed to crush, rip, and tear other ships into pieces. For use in especially close range, these weapons can target any other ship or mega creature in an adjacent square (a target within 500 feet). Ship melee weapons can&rsquo;t be replaced like normal ship weapons, nor can they replace normal ship weapons.</p>\n<h2>Systems</h2>\n<p>A ship relies on a myriad of technological systems to provide most of its noncombative functions. All ships have a ship computer which provides executive function to all its other systems, and nearly all possess a life support system.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each system has 10 mega hit points. If a strategic attack on a system reduces it to 0 hit points, it is disabled and doesn't function until it is repaired (generally requiring the work of a trained engineer).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The costs to install new systems are found on the System Costs table below. Additional rules regarding installing new systems are in the Customizing your Ship section.</p>\n<table style=\"width: 231px;\" border=\"0\" width=\"236\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><colgroup><col style=\"width: 147.5px;\" width=\"115\" /> <col style=\"width: 80.5px;\" width=\"121\" /> </colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl65\" style=\"height: 15.0pt; width: 86pt;\" width=\"115\" height=\"20\">\n<h2>System Costs</h2>\n</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl68\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\"><em>System</em></td>\n<td class=\"xl69\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\"><em>Cost</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Arcane Cannon</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">10,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Cloaking</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">16,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Communications</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">1,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Fabricator</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">2,500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Hypercapacitor</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">7,500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Life Pods</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">2,500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Life Support</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">1,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Probe</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">1,500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Sensors</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">1,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Shield Generator</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">5,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Shuttle</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">1,250 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Sickbay</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">5,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Simulator</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">6,250 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Teleporters</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">20,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Tractor Beam</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">10,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Umbilicus</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">1,500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Arcane Cannon</h3>\n<p>This immensely sophisticated station focuses and magnifies a spellcaster&rsquo;s power, allowing them to cast spells that lay waste to entire fleets. To use an arcane cannon, you must be a spellcaster and be in the Gunner role. The cannon allows you to see ships as if you were on the bridge, which enables you to target ships with spells.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To use the arcane cannon, you must first use your action to charge it for one round. Charging the cannon doesn't expend a spell slot, but if the cannon is not used on the next round, it discharges harmlessly and must be charged again.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you use your action to cast an evocation spell into the charged arcane cannon, you can choose a ship as a target instead of a creature. The spell must have a duration of Instantaneous and a range of 5 feet or greater. The GM can decide if a spell is inappropriate to be magnified by the cannon.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The arcane cannon transforms the spell into a mega spell; as such, this spell fails if it is cast within an area of gravitation. Its range and the dimensions of its spell effects are multiplied by 100, to a maximum range of 10,000 feet. Also, the spell deals mega damage instead of normal damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a spell cast through the arcane cannon targeting a ship calls for a saving throw, the pilot makes that saving throw on behalf of the ship itself. Abilities like Evasion don't affect this type of saving throw.</p>\n<h3>Cloaking</h3>\n<p>The engineer must use their action to activate or deactivate this system, causing the ship to become invisible or to return to visibility. This invisibility ends if your ship attacks, takes damage, moves more than 500 feet on its turn, or if anyone aboard the ship casts a spell or uses a system (such as a teleporter) that penetrates the ship&rsquo;s hull. The ship can be invisible for a total of 5 minutes each day, though this time doesn't need to be used in consecutive turns. This time recharges 24 hours after use.</p>\n<h3>Communications</h3>\n<p>For two ships to communicate, they must both have a functioning communications system and be within 1,000<br />miles of one another. This system normally transmits only audio communication, and most systems also translate it to the listener&rsquo;s language, as per the tongues spell (though older models and those in disrepair are less likely to have<br />this feature).</p>\n<h3>Fabricator</h3>\n<p>Though most ships carry rations for long journeys, many employ a magic fabricator which replicates the effects of the create food and water spell to provide a reliable source of nourishment for the entire crew. Indeed, many view this type of system as being a part of life support itself.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some ships use even more sophisticated replicators, capable of not only creating food and drink, but also capable of manufacturing just about anything, as per the fabricate spell. Though these more sophisticated systems are phenomenally expensive, they&rsquo;re essential for the largest of ships, which contain innumerable parts which can fail at a moment&rsquo;s notice. Any ship of Corvette size or larger with this system can be expected to have the fabricate version of this system installed.</p>\n<h3>Hypercapacitor</h3>\n<p>A hypercapacitor is an immense secondary power cell, which slowly charges itself until it contains a staggering quantity of arcane energy. The engineer can discharge the hypercapacitor in place of supplying a spell slot of 5th<br />level or lower to power a void jump or overcharge the engine. Once discharged, it takes 24 hours to charge, but a spellcaster can use their action and expend a spell slot of the same level as the Dark Matter engine&rsquo;s class to charge<br />it early. A ship can have no more than two hypercapacitors installed at one time.</p>\n<h3>Life Pods</h3>\n<p>In the event of catastrophic ship failure, life pods are the last hope for survival. A ship with this system has a single-person life pod for each crew member and passenger. At any time, you can use your action to board a life pod and eject from the ship. The pod travels far enough to clear any explosion of the ship, then drifts aimlessly. The pod has extremely minimal thrusters&mdash;enough to change direction two or three times&mdash;and enough air, power, and rations to sustain its passenger for 7 days. Each life pod automatically produces a distress signal that can be detected by any ship with sensors, though such a signal only travels at the speed of light&mdash;very slow by galactic scale. A life pod can survive reentry on most planets.</p>\n<h3>Life Support</h3>\n<p>Providing a ship with air, heat, and artificial gravity, a life support system is the most integral part of a ship for its crew. If a life support system is disabled, a temporary life support system will typically be engaged, providing the ship with air and heat for up to an hour, but not restoring artificial gravity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For less conventional starships, such as those shaped as galleons or which are built within great trees, the life support system extends a bubble of heat and atmosphere around the entire ship.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is possible to survive for some time without a functioning life support system, as long as crew members have functioning life suits, but these alternatives are frequently a temporary stop-gap while the life support is repaired.<br />A crew member with sufficient privileges with the ship computer aboard the bridge of a ship can normally disable the life support manually as an action. Depending on the ship, this may allow them to vent atmosphere from the ship, disable the artificial gravity (rendering the entire ship a zero-gravity environment, if it&rsquo;s in space), disable the ship&rsquo;s heaters, or do all of those things to all or part of the ship.</p>\n<h3>Probe</h3>\n<p>This remotely piloted drone is deployed from the ship to analyze potentially hazardous environments ahead of the ship itself. The probe has no combat capabilities but transmits everything it sees and hears back to its controller. If the probe strays more than 100 miles from the controller, it loses connection and falls dormant until the controller unit is within signal range. The statistics for a probe are included in the Example Ships section.</p>\n<h3>Sensors</h3>\n<p>The vast majority of ships are equipped with an array of sensors used to pinpoint ships and other obstacles within 100 miles. If these sensors are missing or disabled, a ship can only see and make attacks within its cone of movement.</p>\n<h3>Shield Generator</h3>\n<p>A massive arcane projector, pulsing with waves of abjuration magic, a shield generator is required for a ship to have a directional shield. If it is disabled, a ship loses all of its shield points until it is repaired.</p>\n<h3>Shuttle</h3>\n<p>Like fighters, shuttles are smaller ships which can be deployed from a parent ship as an action to perform a number of operations. Whereas fighters are strictly offensive, however, shuttles aren't typically equipped with weapons, and can instead hold a more sizable crew and a larger capacity of cargo. Shuttles are usually used to ferry people and goods between the main ship and a planet&rsquo;s surface, and make for a cheap and effective alternative to teleportation. The statistics for a shuttle are included in the Example Ships section.</p>\n<h3>Sickbay</h3>\n<p>Illness and injury are bound to happen on a starship, and without a dedicated healer onboard, a sickbay is a critical facility on any starship. This system has a pool of 6 medical dice, which are d8s. Each of these dice recharge 24 hours after being used. You can spend 1 minute in a sickbay and expend one or more of these dice to cause you or another creature in the sickbay to regain hit points equal to the value rolled. Alternatively, you can expend 3 medical dice to cure yourself of any disease or poison afflicting you or another creature in the sickbay.</p>\n<h3>Simulator</h3>\n<p>Because voyages aboard a starship can last months or even years at a time, simulating the luxuries of home can be a great boon to the crew's morale. A simulator is an immensely complex room, technically a sentient magic item, that employs dozens of systems to create the effects of the spells hallucinatory terrain and major image to replicate entire environments and situations. Though this system was designed to train crew members for dangerous situations and to simulate tactical battles, it is just as often employed for entertainment purposes.</p>\n<h3>Teleporters</h3>\n<p>Blinking from the inside of a ship onto the surface of a planet is an invaluable function for many starships. As such, many ships contain a number of permanent teleportation circles specially designed for this type of short-range transportation. The ship&rsquo;s engineer can use their action to activate the teleportation system, targeting a single unmoving location within 100 miles of the ship and creating a temporary destination teleportation circle at that location. This circle lasts for 1 minute or until another teleportation circle is created. Because the resonance of a Dark Matter engine interferes with the teleportation magic, you can&rsquo;t create a destination circle inside a ship which has a functioning Dark Matter engine unless engineers on both ships coordinate the teleporters to allow transit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes, a network of teleportation circles will be set up inside particularly large ships to facilitate quick navigation. Such teleporters are constantly active.</p>\n<h3>Tractor Beam</h3>\n<p>A tractor beam is a very large device designed to pull spacecraft and other objects toward the ship. If you are in the Engineer role, you can use your action to make a ranged spell attack using a tractor beam. The target must be an object or ship within 3,000 feet that is less than half the size of your ship and isn't moving away from it. If you are not a spellcaster, you only add your proficiency bonus to this attack roll.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a hit, the target is caught in the tractor beam. At the beginning of each of your turns, you can use your action to maintain the beam and pull the target up to 500 feet closer to your ship. The target can&rsquo;t otherwise move while it is within the tractor beam.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the target is a ship, it can attempt to break free of the tractor beam. The pilot of the target ship can make a Dexterity (Piloting) check on its turn, opposed by your Intelligence (Technology) check. If you fail, the ship uses half its movement speed to escape the tractor beam and can move freely for the remainder of its movement.</p>\n<h3>Umbilicus</h3>\n<p>An umbilicus is a long, hollow cable which extends from one ship to another (a maximum of 100 feet), allowing the transport of people and goods between the two without&nbsp; compromising the hull of either ship. An umbilicus is required to board another ship.</p>\n<h2>Customizing Your Ship</h2>\n<p>As parts fail and repairs are made in the Black, most ships start to look less and less like their original factory models and more like customized Frankenstein ships, composed of parts from dozens of vessels, strapped to a vaguely familiar frame. Sometimes, these sorts of repairs are necessary to keep the ship operating, but other times, they&rsquo;re optional, made solely to upgrade the original model in desirable ways. There are four general varieties of customizations you can give a ship: upgrading a ship&rsquo;s Dark Matter engine, replacing weapons, adding new systems, and other general upgrades. You can install two or more upgrades at the same time, as long as you have access to a spaceport and enough people to install all the upgrades simultaneously.</p>\n<h3>Upgrading a Dark Matter Engine</h3>\n<p>Installing a new Dark Matter engine is no trivial task. The void crystals at the core of a Dark Matter engine are extremely fragile and must be in pristine condition to operate correctly. If an engine is installed incorrectly, the void crystals will likely be damaged, resulting in an immediate (or delayed) instability event, consuming the ship and all aboard it in a sphere of annihilation. Often, automatons will perform most of the testing after trained engineers have installed the crystals. Despite the risk and the cost, you can upgrade a ship&rsquo;s Dark Matter engine by 1 class (or install a Class 1 Dark Matter engine into a ship that didn&rsquo;t have one) with 7 days of work and a cost in materials and labor<br />as shown on the Dark Matter Upgrade table. Upgrading a Dark Matter engine on a ship larger than a frigate is generally impossible, as larger engines are too deeply interconnected to the ship to be replaced.</p>\n<table style=\"height: 105px; width: 228px;\" border=\"0\" width=\"236\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><colgroup><col style=\"width: 167px;\" width=\"115\" /> <col style=\"width: 257px;\" width=\"121\" /> </colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 15px;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15px; width: 177pt;\" colspan=\"2\" width=\"236\" height=\"20\">\n<h2>Dark Matter Upgrade</h2>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15px;\">\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"height: 15px;\" height=\"20\"><em>Ship Size</em></td>\n<td class=\"xl65\" style=\"width: 91pt; height: 15px;\" width=\"121\"><em>Cost</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15px;\">\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"height: 15px;\" height=\"20\">Fighter</td>\n<td class=\"xl65\" style=\"width: 91pt; height: 15px;\" width=\"121\">2,500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15px;\">\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"height: 15px;\" height=\"20\">Personal</td>\n<td class=\"xl65\" style=\"width: 91pt; height: 15px;\" width=\"121\">5,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15px;\">\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"height: 15px;\" height=\"20\">Transport</td>\n<td class=\"xl65\" style=\"width: 91pt; height: 15px;\" width=\"121\">12,500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15px;\">\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"height: 15px;\" height=\"20\">Corvette</td>\n<td class=\"xl65\" style=\"width: 91pt; height: 15px;\" width=\"121\">25,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15px;\">\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"height: 15px;\" height=\"20\">Frigate</td>\n<td class=\"xl65\" style=\"width: 91pt; height: 15px;\" width=\"121\">37,500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Upgrading Weapons</h3>\n<p>The ideal ship would have dozens of weapons installed on every external surface, covering every possible direction with extreme firepower. Reality, however, gets in the way. Because each weapon needs a gunner, each external weapon is linked to a single gunner station on the inside of the ship. Unfortunately, this means most ships can&rsquo;t install additional weapons&mdash;doing so would require a complete overhaul of the ship&rsquo;s internal layout.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is relatively simple, however, to replace one ship weapon with another. Doing so requires 1 day of work and the cost of the weapon to be installed. Removed weapons can be kept in storage (though most are massively heavy and spacious) or sold at half market value.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can also change the mounting location of a facing weapon with 8 hours of work, choosing for the weapon to be installed facing the front, back, left, or right of the ship.</p>\n<h3>Adding New Systems</h3>\n<p>Ships have a wide variety of systems at their disposal, expanding their capabilities and comforts, making them both powerful weapons and cozy homes. Ships have room to install three additional systems before space on board becomes a significant problem. However, fightersized ships have much tighter space, and have no room for additional systems. After the maximum number of systems are installed, new systems can only be installed by removing other systems from the ship.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Installing a shield generator on a ship that doesn't have one gives that ship 8 shield points.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can install a new system with 7 days of work and a cost in materials and labor as shown on the System Costs table.</p>\n<h3>Other Upgrades</h3>\n<p>Starships can be outfitted with an array of upgrades that aren&rsquo;t as modular as replacing a weapon or adding a newsystem. Each of the following upgrades can be installed on a ship once, unless otherwise specified. You can install a new system with 7 days of work and a cost in materials and labor as shown in the Ship Upgrades table.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"width: 306px;\" border=\"0\" width=\"285\"

in alphabetical order.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Afterburners</strong></em>. Your ship&rsquo;s movement speed increases by 500 feet if the pilot moves it in a straight line.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>AI Core</strong></em>. Your ship's computer has an installed construct core that manifests a sentient shipboard artificial intelligence. This AI serves to keep the ship in running order and has some interaction with all of the ship's systems, allowing it to see and hear every part of the ship and control all of its systems. It can communicate with the ship's passengers via the ship's computer system and any built-in intercom systems on the ship.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The AI has an Intelligence of 17, a Charisma of 14, and a Wisdom of 13. It is proficient in Technology (+5) and Data (+5). It can make Intelligence checks when any situation arises and will inform its passengers of any information it knows.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, at a crew member's command, the AI can directly assume any character role aboard the ship. The AI can perform any action provided by that role, taking its turn at the end of the initiative order. The ship adds +3 to all of its attack rolls.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AI personalities can vary wildly. Some are snarky and occasionally play jokes on their crew, while others are fiercely logical and derive pleasure chiefly from calculating probabilities to dozens of decimal places. All, however, generally enjoy their hulls and decks being cleaned regularly.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Antivirus Module</strong></em>. Your ship has a secondary arcane terminal which screens all access to the ship computer for hacking attempts. Any attempt to hack the ship&rsquo;s computer or any system or door control has disadvantage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Arcana-Resistant Coating</strong></em>. Any crew member that must make a saving throw to resist a magic effect originating from outside the ship can add +2 to the roll.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Assault Port</strong></em>. Dogfighters can deploy from your ship as a bonus action, rather than an action.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ship must have the Dogfighter role to accept this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Captain&rsquo;s Chair</strong></em>. Your ship comes equipped with a luxurious command chair, laden with communication controls and a single prominent red button. The captain can take one of their special actions as a bonus action, and regains the ability to do so after 24 hours. The captain can&rsquo;t take the same special action twice on the same turn.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ship must have the Captain role to accept this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Countermeasures</strong></em>. Your ship has a series of flares or a deployable decoy designed to confuse the targeting of a pursuing vessel. You can trigger your countermeasures as a reaction when you are targeted by an attack, causing that attack to have disadvantage. Once you use your countermeasures, you must load a new set in a process which takes 1 minute.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ship must be fighter-sized to accept this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Cruising Engines</strong></em>. Your ship&rsquo;s sublight speed is doubled.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Ded Reckoner</strong></em>. Your ship has a complex flight computer, which attempts to calculate a course through the Void. When you make a blind void jump, you can add +5 to the roll.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ship must have a Dark Matter engine to accept this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Detonation Failsafe</strong></em>. Your ship is less likely to suffer catastrophic failure and has advantage on detonation saving throws.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Expanded Hold</strong></em>. Your ship&rsquo;s cargo capacity increases by 50%.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Expanded Quarters</strong></em>. Your ship can hold 25% more passengers (rounded up) above its normal capacity without overly taxing the life support during long voyages.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>External Manipulators</strong></em>. A pair of extensible clawed arms can fold out from the hull of your ship or fold down again as an action. These arms can reach up 50 feet and can each push, pull, or grip with a maximum force of 1,000 pounds.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Internal Reinforcements</strong></em>. You have improved the integrity of your fighter by filling every hollow space with lightweight reinforcements. Your fighter&rsquo;s mega hit points increases by 10.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ship must be fighter-sized to accept this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Jump Rift</strong></em>. When your ship makes a void jump, any ship within 500 feet of it is carried with it when it jumps.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ship must have a Dark Matter engine to accept this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Lifeform Scanner</strong></em>. You enhance your ship&rsquo;s sensors to be able to detect living creatures. The ship&rsquo;s engineer can spend 1 minute to scan a ship within 100 miles to determine the exact number of living humanoids onboard.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ship must have sensors to accept this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Live Feed</strong></em>. Your communications system provides a live video feed or holographic image of both parties. The recipient can choose whether or not to mask their image from your feed. Both parties must have a live feed to use this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ship must have communications to accept this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Material Analyzer</strong></em>. Your sensors have been upgraded with a directional scanner that determines a target's composition. The ship&rsquo;s engineer can spend 1 minute to scan a target within 1,000 miles, learning by percent which metals, minerals, and materials make up the target.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ship must have sensors to accept this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Medical Station</strong></em>. A complete overhaul of your ship's sickbay has made it analogous to a small hospital. Your sickbay has twice as many (12) medical dice. Additionally, you can spend 1 minute and expend 3 medical dice to remove a level of exhaustion from yourself or another creature in the sickbay, or to end one of the following conditions afflicting you or another creature in the sickbay: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ship must have a sickbay to accept this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Overshield</strong></em>. An additional generator is added to supplement the shields, increasing your ship&rsquo;s maximum<br />shield points by 6.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ship must have a shield generator to accept this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Panic Drive</strong></em>. Your ship&rsquo;s Dark Matter engine has been heavily customized with a secondary arcane engine to pump energy into the core for faster, but more erratic charging times. Once the engineer has taken the Void Jump action to charge the Dark Matter engine, they can use their action on each of their subsequent turns to panic jump the Dark Matter drive, possibly jumping early. Roll a d6. On a 5 or 6, the ship jumps early.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ship must have a Dark Matter engine to accept this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Radio Array</strong></em>. Your ship can communicate with another ship out to a range of 10,000 miles, rather than 1,000 miles. If the receiving ship has communications but does not have this upgrade, it can receive messages, but not transmit replies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ship must have communications to receive this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Reinforced Hull</strong></em>. Great alloyed bands are attached on the exterior of the hull, increasing your ship&rsquo;s AC by 1.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Repair Drones</strong></em>. A series of mechanized drones patrol the outer side of the hull, automatically sealing leaks and repairing structural damage. If your ship is below half its hit point maximum, it regains 1 mega hit point at the beginning of the initiative order.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Targeting Optics</strong></em>. One installed ship weapon of your choice gains a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls and its range increases by 500 feet. You can choose this upgrade more than once, applying it to a different weapon each time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Tri-Probe</strong></em>. Instead of holding only one drone, your probe bay instead holds three. Each of these probes can be controlled independently.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ship must have a probe to receive this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Smuggler&rsquo;s Hold</strong></em>. Your ship has hidden compartments in its hold, perfect for smuggling. These compartments can hold up to 1,000 pounds (which don't count against your ship&rsquo;s cargo capacity) in objects no larger than 6 feet in any dimension.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/ship-pg157.png","_id":"xh5FVWG7LTgZAAaK"}

Coming and going in the middle of the night to dissect livestock and experiment on intelligent creatures, amoeboid ships are somewhat infamous for their role in researching primitive worlds. More often, however, amoeboid saucers and motherships can be found hovering around and leaping between maw stations, their symmetric, sophisticated designs perfectly reflecting that of most amoeboid technology, including much of the maws themselves.</p>\n<h2>Avia-Ra Ships</h2>\n<p>The mighty arm of the avia-ra in the Holy Lands is the Congregation, a fleet of righteous ships dedicated to carrying the fury and enlightenment of the Sun Above to heretics the universe over. Its flagship, The Prophet, is a vessel of terrifying might, and is said to have burned its mark into every elven ship it crossed during the days of the Night Crusade. Now, it slumbers peacefully with much of the Congregation in a large perimeter around the Sepulcher Star, awaiting another grand Crusade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avia-Ra ships demonstrate a meeting of traditional design, canny ingenuity, and startling ruthlessness. There is no better evidence of this than the scorchers borne by most ships in the Congregation: a powerful symbol of the Sun's might, and also a deceptively simple circumvention of elven shield technology.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;When you see that ship&rsquo;s firepower, you can feel it in your bones.&rdquo;<br />&mdash; Dietrich Hildbrand, human mercenary captain, on seeing The Prophet</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Dwarven Ships</h2>\n<p>Dwarven shipwrights are renowned for their craftsmanship and engineering, and as such, dwarven ships are the gold standard for quality and dependability. If properly maintained, a dwarven vessel can see centuries of continuous use, long outliving its creators. These machines are designed to tackle tough jobs&mdash;asteroid mining, interstellar hauling, and deep space salvage&mdash;and are named appropriately, but never seem to break down; indeed, they almost seem to perform better when the going gets rough.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dwarven starship designs and innovations have been adapted and emulated by all comers, leaving the marks of Jormund engineers on human, vect, and avia-ra ships.</p>\n<h2>Elven Ships</h2>\n<p>Elven ships aren't so much constructed as grown, shaped from living ironwood trees. Indeed, there are few vessels in existence that can match an elven ship for beauty or speed. Many are made to resemble traditional sailing ships, with similar bows, sails, and open decks, but all components are formed from great boughs and limbs of ironwood. Pound for pound, no metal can match ironwood for strength, and elven ships rely on this strength and lightness to achieve extreme maneuverability.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As elven ships grow larger, they become more arboreal, with weapons mounted in high limbs and engines fixed in the deepest roots. The grandest of vessels, such as The Hyperion, are thriving cities in their own right, centers of arcane knowledge, and symbols of elven superiority for the rest of the &lsquo;verse.</p>\n<h2>Gnomish Ships</h2>\n<p>A bitter diatribe on prevailing magical technology, gnomish vessels are the epitome of high-tech, cruising through the stars without so much as an arcane battery. As such, gnomes can fly without hindrance into Dead Magic Zones and can penetrate deep into the uncharted territory beyond. The largest Dead Magic Zones even provide some measure of protection for the Gnomish Flotilla, the permanent armada of gnomish ships, and demonstrate the spite most gnomes hold for magic in general: even approaching the Flotilla from the wrong angle will strand an ordinary ship without power in the Black, a death sentence for those who are not promptly rescued.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The advances and complexities of gnomish ships are due to their growing mastery of a baffling art known as science. Guided by this philosophy, gnomish ships are apt to follow different naming conventions: blasters are more likely to be called lasers, sickbays are more likely to be called hospitals, and so on.</p>\n<h2>Human Ships</h2>\n<p>When humans look at the vast emptiness of space, they&rsquo;re not crushed by a weight of burden, nor are they confounded by its meaning; they are instead overwhelmed by an urge to explore. Humans are a young race in the grand scheme of things, but they have made leaps and bounds technologically, bolstering the Hegemony and setting human spacecraft apart from others.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pragmatic almost to a fault, human ships are always purpose-driven in form. Freelancers excel for lone agents, Explorers can probe the farthest depths of space, and Warbringers are utterly ruthless in combat. Regardless of intended function, human ships are innovative and rugged, capable of meeting any trial the &lsquo;verse throws their way.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"We're seeking out new life and civilizations. To blow them to pieces. Welcome to The Antioch, Hegemony warbringer, heavy cruiser class.\"<br />&mdash; Admiral Banebridge's introduction to civilians touring The Antioch</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Lakshayan Ships</h2>\n<p>The Lakshayan people are warriors, ever battle-hardened against the Warhorde, and their ships are a testament to their readiness. In the War of Expansion, the garrison at Lakshay needed a weapon that could engage the goblinoid enemy on land, in the air, and in space, and they had little resources to accomplish this, apart from a new shipment of impulse frames, designed with space marines in mind. With these frames, the Lakshayan engineers devised the first Battle Frame, a gargantuan, rocket-powered, mechanized exoskeleton, armed with a sword and salvos of micro-missiles. Each Frame requires a seasoned pilot, but their sheer versatility and mobility makes them a terror to orcs, and a devastating weapon for any theater of conflict.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than just a ship, a Lakshayan battle frame is an extension of the pilot, and using one is a dance of tactical maneuvers and precision strikes. The deadliest Lakshayan pilots, called Oni, are as fearsome in person as they are in a frame.</p>\n<h2>Nautilid Ships</h2>\n<p>Lonely nautilid whorl ships wander the galaxy, searching for a world that might not even exist. When their homeworld of Poseidon was destroyed, the only haven left to the nautilid race were their immense ships, filled with the rare aqueous solution in which they can thrive. Indeed, whereas other ships and life suits are designed to withhold a volume of air, nautilid ships and suits are pumped with water and a cocktail of minerals specific to their race. Visitors to nautilid ships, therefore, need to prepare as if going on a deep dive or a spacewalk before coming aboard.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The design of whorl ships, and the smaller pincer ships, are inspired by the long-dead undersea creatures of Poseidon; their hulls resemble great shells, and their landing gear, immense legs. True to their name, pincers are even armed with immense crab claws, capable of shredding smaller craft in a matter of minutes.</p>\n<h2>Orc Ships</h2>\n<p>Never let it be said that orc ships aren't at least effective. Industrial in the sense that they run on gasoline, coal, and other crude sources, orc ships spout smoke and sputter flame as they tear across the sky. These pragmatic design influences are matched with strictly aesthetic ones: an orcish rig can usually be found with attractive accessories and an eye-catching paint job.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other goblinoids, including bugbears and goblins, also tend to tend to use general orc ship designs, but take far less care with the workmanship, leading to uneven hulls and barely-stable Dark Matter cores. These ships have garnered the moniker &ldquo;scrap ships&rdquo;, whereas true orc ships are called &ldquo;rigs&rdquo; or &ldquo;rides&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the model, a small contingent of orc ships make a ready fighting force, as they are sensibly built and battle-tested in the Warzone.</p>\n<h2>Vect Ships</h2>\n<p>No craft in existence works precisely like a vect ship. Utilitarian to the point of volatility, vect ships abandon all systems and features not strictly related to their operation, forgoing even life-support; after all, vect don't need to breathe, and the exposed arcane engines powering their ships provide just enough heat to keep the pilot from freezing to death. Exploiting their nature as living constructs, vect pilots plug directly into their ships, creating something of a hybrid intelligence, split between the pilot, the ship, and the swarm as a whole. The link is inherently frail; removing the pilot incorrectly or critically damaging the ship invariably results in a ship-wide detonation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the centuries following the Night Crusade and the liberation of vect in the galaxy, most vect ships have been decommissioned&mdash;their volatility proving to be too much of a liability for everyday use. But some militant splinter cells of vect, often separatists or religious zealots, can still be found employing the designs, which, though inherently nstable, are extremely formidable in combat.</p>\n<h2>Wrothian Ships</h2>\n<p>Wrothian ships are like a thing out of a nightmare. Their inky black shells are almost featureless, with smooth<br />curves that lend them an alien silhouette from every angle. But within those shells is something even stranger: a living, organic interior.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as other wrothian technology, like collection vats and brains in a jar, is alive with a kind of bestial intelligence, so too are their ships. On the inside, the chitinous black exoskeletons give way to tough, crimson tissue that lines the walls and hallways. Structures of black chitin form biomechanical interfaces, devices, rooms, and hallways. A stygian ship can nearly pilot itself, but is driven by psionic impulse from wrothian primarchs, who reside near the ship's nervous center.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These ships are nourished by the same psionic energy that sustains the wroth themselves; they are integral to the wrothian lifecycle. Deep in the Black, the wroth inhabit their stygian ships, emerging only to raid planets for humanoids, harvesting them for their bio-matter and minds. These minds are processed into brains in a jar, whose psionic potential nourishes the ships and the wrothians themselves, perpetuating the cycle.</p>\n<h2>Miscellaneous Ships</h2>\n<p>The following ships are evidence of convergent design in action: whereas flying cars, freighters, and space stations are constructed by engineers of every race, the most efficient designs transcend industrial trends favored by different empires. Though an elven flying car might be made of sleek ironwood and a dwarven one would feature hard angles and a more spacious trunk, they're both more alike than they are different, and consequently share the same statistics.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pragmatic but inefficient designs also belong in this category. The Battle Planetoid, for example, is an asteroid or small moon retrofitted with engines, life support, and a small Dark Matter engine. Though utterly impractical, goblins, kobolds, and other small races have utilized this design time and again.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The exception to this rule is a ship that literally belongs nowhere else: the Infinity is a legendary vessel, made by no race living today. Endlessly cycling the galaxy, this ship crosses its breadth each day on an unpredictable course, falling out of void jumps just long enough to charge up the next one. Glimpsing it between jumps is a one in a billion occasion. No one knows who designed the ship and set it on its lonely orbit, and to date, no one has been able to approach and board the ship before it once again jumps. It is an enigma; perhaps a relic of an ancient galactic empire, a visitor from another galaxy, or something even stranger.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/ship-pg157.png","_id":"9wSk6xZGd57gFOfO"}

The Captain, Dogfighter, and Engineer roles are optional; a captain provides extra actions to the crew, the engineer manages power flow and shields, and a dogfighter detaches from the main ship to target the weak points on enemy craft.</p>\n<h2>Initiative</h2>\n<p>When ship combat begins, each character must take a role on the ship to participate. A character's actions with regards to the ship are limited to the role they choose. Entire enemy ships act on a single turn of the initiative order, whereas individual characters act separately. However, if a character is in the role of the Captain, the entire crew can act on a single turn of the initiative order.</p>\n<h2>Character Roles</h2>\n<p>Each character on a starship chooses one of the following roles when they roll initiative. Depending on the ship, some roles, such as Gunner, might be occupied by one character, more than one character, or might not exist at all. By contrast, roles like Pilot are usually occupied only by one character.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A character can switch roles with another character or can switch to an unoccupied role as an action.</p>\n<h3>Captain</h3>\n<p>As the captain, you direct the ship's operations and manage the crew. If you choose to be the captain when the ship rolls initiative, you roll initiative for the entire ship. The entire party acts on that turn in the initiative order while you are captain, and you can choose in which order the crew members take their turns. If you leave the Captain role or fall unconscious, the party rolls initiative separately at the end of the next initiative order.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a captain, you can use the following actions:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Boarding Party</em></strong>. When the conditions for Boarding are met, you can use your action as the captain to form a boarding party (which you can choose to be a part of) and deploy the umbilicus.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong><em>Brace for Impact</em></strong>. You can use your action to brace the ship for damage. Each time your ship takes damage before the beginning of your next turn, you can roll 1d6 and subtract the number rolled from the mega damage your ship takes, to a minimum of 1.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div title=\"Page 194\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Deep Scan</strong></em>. If your ship is equipped with sensors, you can use your action to order a deep scan of a specific object of interest within range of the sensors. This allows you to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check to examine that object.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Fire at Will</strong></em>. You use your action to declare a barrage. One gunner of your choice can then use its reaction to make one attack with a ship weapon.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Full Speed Ahead</strong></em>. You use your action to push the engines. The pilot can then use its reaction to move the ship half its movement within the cone of movement.</p>\n<h3>Dogfighter</h3>\n<p>You deploy in a lighter, more maneuverable vessel to disable enemy fighters and target the vital locations of hostile ships. You can use your action to launch your fighter-sized ship from the main ship or to dock with it while you are adjacent to it. You can only switch roles while your fighter is docked with the main ship.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once launched, you can move your fighter's entire speed on its turn and use your action to fire its weapons. Movement and weapon attacks follow the same rules<br />as the Pilot&rsquo;s Move action and the Gunner&rsquo;s Open Fire action, except that moving your fighter doesn't require an action. You can also take the Pilot&rsquo;s Dogfighting action.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your fighter drops to 0 hit points and is destroyed, you can use your reaction to eject from the craft in a life pod to survive the explosion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While acting as a dogfighter, you can take the following special action:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Targeted Attack</strong></em>. While you are within 1,000 feet of another ship, you can use your action to attempt to disable one of that ship&rsquo;s systems. When you do so, make an attack targeting the ship with disadvantage. On a hit, you deal damage directly to a system of your choice, a weapon of your choice, or the ship&rsquo;s impulse engines. If the attack is blocked by a shield, the damage is subtracted from the target ship&rsquo;s shield points before it damages any system. Systems, weapons, and engines have 10 mega hit points each. Damage to systems is also deducted from the target ship&rsquo;s hit points.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a system or weapon drops to 0 hit points, it is disabled. Any creature operating a weapon when it is destroyed takes normal damage (as opposed to mega damage) equal to the damage dealt. If the engines drop to 0 hit points, the ship is crippled and can only move at half speed.</p>\n<h3>Engineer</h3>\n<p>As the engineer, you can direct power around the ship and position the ship's directional shield. By default, the shield is forward-facing and active.</p>\n<p>The ship's shield covers only one of the ship's four sides. As a bonus action, you can switch the direction the shield faces. If an attack hits the ship on its shielded side, damage is subtracted from the ship's shield points, rather than its hit points.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the initiative order, the shield regains half its maximum shield points, rounded up.</p>\n<p>As an engineer, you have the following actions available to you:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Directing Power</strong></em>. You can use your action to deactivate the shield and direct its power elsewhere: either to the impulse engines or into one of the ship&rsquo;s weapons. If you invest the power in the ship&rsquo;s engines, the ship&rsquo;s movement speed increases by half until the beginning of your next turn. If you invest the power in one of the ship&rsquo;s weapons, a gunner can make one additional attack using that weapon when they take the Open Fire action.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can draw power from the ship&rsquo;s weapons and invest it in the ship's shields. When you do so, until the beginning of your next turn, the ship's shields&nbsp;cover two of its consecutive sides, instead of only one, and it regains all of its shield points at the beginning of the initiative order, instead of only half. In exchange, each gunner makes one weapon attack fewer than normal when they take the Open Fire action.</p>\n<div title=\"Page 195\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<p><em><strong>Overcharge</strong></em>. If you are a spellcaster, you can use your action to expend a spell slot with a level greater than or equal to the Dark Matter engine's class to overcharge the engine. The shield recharges completely, and until the beginning of your next turn, power is invested in the ship&rsquo;s engines (increasing the ship&rsquo;s movement speed by half) and every gun (allowing each gunner to make one additional attack using that weapon when they take the Open Fire action on their turn). Once you use this ability, you can&rsquo;t use it again for 1 minute.</p>\n<p><em><strong>System Repair</strong></em>. You can use your action to repair a ship system or weapon that has 0 hit points and is deactivated. When you do so, make a DC 15 Intelligence (Technology) check. On a success, the system or weapon regains 1 mega hit point and reactivates at the beginning of your next turn.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Void Jump</strong></em>. You can begin the charging process for a void jump. Once a Dark Matter engine has begun to charge, it will jump in 1 minute. No intervention can stop or slow this process; once it is begun, nothing short of destroying the ship can interrupt the jump. The pilot is responsible for guiding the ship on the jump itself and rolls on the Jump Navigation table when the jump begins.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div title=\"Page 196\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h3>Gunner&nbsp;</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div title=\"Page 194\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div title=\"Page 196\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Acquiring targets and calculating ranges, you fire the shipboard weapons on hostile targets. Many ship weapons don't have any facing rules, but those which do are normally mounted to the front or to one of the sides of the ship. If a weapon has the Facing property, it can only be fired in a 90-degree cone in the direction in which it was mounted.</p>\n<p>While you are in the Gunner role, you can only operate one of the ship&rsquo;s weapons at a time. You can use a bonus action on your turn to switch between weapons.</p>\n<p>You add your proficiency bonus and Dexterity modifier to an attack roll you make with a ship&rsquo;s weapon, but you don't add any ability modifier to the weapon&rsquo;s damage rolls. Weapon entries in the Example Ships section include an example attack bonus, to be used only if the GM controls the ship as an NPC.</p>\n<p>As a gunner, you can take the following actions:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Open Fire</strong></em>. You can take the Attack action on your turn to attack with one of the ship&rsquo;s weapons. You can make multiple attacks with this weapon if you have a feature, such as Extra Attack, that gives you extra attacks.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Readied Attacks</strong></em>. You can use your action to ready an attack with a ship&rsquo;s weapon, just as you would ready an attack with a normal weapon. Often, this readied action is used to target deployed weapons, such as neutron torpedoes, the moment they are launched, or to strike another ship the moment it opens fire.</p>\n<h3>Pilot</h3>\n<p>As the pilot, you navigate and direct the ship's movement. Each ship has a given speed in hundreds of feet per turn, and a maneuverability score, which is given in degrees. Additionally, each ship faces a particular direction, which is normally in 45-degree intervals, and can be approximated using the eight cardinal directions.</p>\n<p>To approximate momentum, each ship's movement is limited to a cone of movement, which extends in the direction your ship is facing and is as wide as the ship&rsquo;s Maneuverability score, measured in degrees.</p>\n<p>As the ship&rsquo;s pilot, you can use the following special actions:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Move</strong></em>. You use your action to move the ship up to its speed within the ship&rsquo;s cone of movement. Once you have finished moving, you can rotate the direction your ship is facing by up to its maneuverability score.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Evasive Maneuvers</strong></em>. If your ship is Corvette-sized or smaller, you can use your action to perform evasive maneuvers instead of moving normally. When you do&nbsp;so, until the beginning of your next turn, you add your Dexterity modifier to the ship's AC and have advantage on Dexterity saving throws you make on behalf of the ship.</p>\n<div title=\"Page 196\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p><em><strong>Dogfighting</strong></em>. If your ship is Corvette-sized or smaller and a ship of the same size classification is behind you within 1,000 feet, you can use your action to perform a complex maneuver. Make a Dexterity (Piloting) check, contested by the other ship. On a success, following several tight turns, you switch places with that ship. The direction both ships face remains the same.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Hard Turn</strong></em>. If your ship is Corvette-sized or smaller, you can use your action to pull a hard turn, rotating your ship almost on the spot. You move your ship 500 feet in any direction and rotate to face any way you choose.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Match Speed</strong></em>. Your ship attempts to move at the same rate and direction as another ship instead of moving normally. Choose one ship that you can see. Until the beginning of your next turn, your ship moves when that ship does and attempts to maintain the same distance from it and angle to it. If the target ship moves faster, is more maneuverable, or uses Hard Turn to perform a movement you are not normally capable of, this effect ends.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Ram</strong></em>. If your ship is Frigate-sized or smaller (and you feel particularly foolhardy), you can ram your ship directly into a target by moving up to your speed within your cone of movement and entering a ship or mega creature&rsquo;s space. Your ship and the target each take 2d10 mega bludgeoning damage. Larger ships deal and take more damage in a ram: Transport ships deal 3d10, Corvettes and Frigates deal 4d10.</p>\n<h3>Damage and Repair</h3>\n<p>A ship&rsquo;s hit points are given in mega points and ship- based weapons usually deal damage in mega points as well. Optionally, the GM can rule that non-mega damage can&rsquo;t affect things which have mega hit points, and that mega damage is instantly lethal to non-mega targets.</p>\n<p>When a ship takes hit point damage, it represents structural damage to its hull which is not easily repaired. The loss of hit points has no effect on a ship&rsquo;s capabilities until the ship drops to 0 hit points. Individual systems and weapons, however, can be disabled by precision strikes, which is separate from normal hit point damage.</p>\n<p>Ships are immune to poison and psychic damage.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Shield Points</strong></em>. If a ship has a shield generator, hit<br />point damage might instead be subtracted from the ship&rsquo;s shield points (SP), which are measured in mega hit points. Shields only cover a part of a ship, normally only one side. If the shortest line from an attacker to a shielded ship lands on a shielded side (or a corner of a shielded side), damage is subtracted from the ship's shield points, rather&nbsp;than its hit points. If an attack reduces the shield to 0 shield points, any excess damage carries over to hit points.</p>\n<div title=\"Page 197\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>A ship with a shield regains half its maximum shield points, rounded up, at the beginning of the engineer&rsquo;s turn (or the start of the initiative order, if the ship has no engineer).</p>\n<h3>Destruction</h3>\n<p>When a ship drops to 0 hit points, it becomes a blazing wreck. All of its systems, including weapons, engines, and life support, cease to function, and it can&rsquo;t regain hit points. Escape craft, like fighters, life pods, and shuttles can still eject from a blazing wreck. The ship is on a tipping point of complete disaster; it might soon explode outright, or otherwise become a derelict wreck.</p>\n<p>Explosion Saving Throws. If the ship is a blazing wreck at the end of the initiative order, one character makes a unique saving throw, called an explosion saving throw. This saving throw isn&rsquo;t tied to any ability score; it is purely dependent on chance.</p>\n<p>Roll a [[/r d20]]. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, the ship becomes a derelict wreck; it is adrift, and all its systems are still disabled, but it is no longer at risk of exploding and can, with extensive efforts, be repaired. On your third failure, the ship explodes, immediately killing any creatures still onboard. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind.</p>\n<p>Damage at 0 Hit Points. If your ship takes any damage while it is a blazing wreck, it suffers an explosion saving throw failure.</p>\n<h3>Repair</h3>\n<p>Repairing a ship is a difficult process requiring many hours of work. During your downtime, you can perform repairs on your ship. For each day you spend performing repairs, you make a DC 15 Intelligence (Technology) check. If you have proficiency in ship maintenance tools, you can add your proficiency bonus to the check, or double your proficiency bonus if you are also proficient with Technology. On a success, the ship regains mega hit points equal to your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. Alternatively, the ship can be repaired completely in one day at port for a fee of 2 gp per mega hit point lost.</p>\n<h3>Boarding</h3>\n<p>Sometimes, your objective in ship-to-ship combat requires that you come aboard a hostile vessel. You can board another vessel if your ship has an umbilicus, if both ships are within 500 feet of each other, and if the pilot of your ship has Matched Speed with the other. When you do so,&nbsp;any number of crew members or passengers can join a boarding party. The umbilicus only remains attached as long as both ships remain within 500 feet of each other.</p>\n<div title=\"Page 197\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>A boarding party and any hostile crew roll their own initiative which acts parallel to ongoing ship combat. Combat as a boarding party is the same as normal combat.</p>\n<p>The boarding party arrives in a room via the umbilicus and can only return to their own ship through the umbilicus. The captain or engineer of the opposing ship can disengage life support (or choose to only deactivate gravity, atmosphere, or heat) or start a self-destruct timer on the ship. Additionally, if the boarding party accesses important locations, such as the engine room, the shield generator, or a battle station housing a ship weapon, they can use the opportunity to destroy or disable the ship's various systems and weapons.</p>\n<p>If the party eliminates all hostile crew members of the boarded ship, they can commandeer it, provided that they have a knowledgeable pilot and enough crew to operate it.</p>\n<h3>NPC Ships</h3>\n<p>The GM doesn't play the individual roles of an NPC ship separately. Rather, each NPC ship rolls its own initiative and can perform all its relevant actions on its turn. In addition, rather than calculating the statistics of gunners, NPC ships use the attack bonuses included in weapon entries and typically have one gunner at each weapon. The GM also decides the relevant ability checks and saving throws for NPC crewmen.</p>\n<p>If an NPC ship has a Captain role, the GM can also allow the ship to take an additional action on its turn.</p>\n<p>Most GMs have NPC ships immediately explode when dropping to 0 hit points. Common exceptions include when one or more player characters has boarded the ship, or when an important NPC or villain is aboard it. Alternatively, the GM can rule that the characters in question escape aboard a life pod or a shuttle shortly before the ship&rsquo;s explosion.</p>\n<h3>Variant Rule: Grid Combat</h3>\n<p>Ship combat is particularly well-suited to using miniatures on a square-based grid map. Using this rule, each square is 500 feet by 500 feet and each ship faces the side or the corner of their surrounding squares. Ships of Transport size or smaller fit within a single square. On its turn, a ship moves 1 square for every 500 feet of its movement.</p>\n<p>When counting distance on a grid, the first diagonal square counts as 1 square of movement, and the second diagonal square as 2 squares. Repeat this pattern of 1 square, 2 squares whenever you count diagonally, even if you move horizontally or vertically between different bits of movement.</p>\n<div title=\"Page 198\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h3>Variant Rule: Planes of Movement</h3>\n<p>Though ship combat primarily takes place on a 2D plane, you can use this variant rule to convert combat into a semblance of 3D space. When combat begins, the GM decides how many Planes of Movement exist. In open space, there might be three to four, while in orbit around a star, there may only be two.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>When moving your ship, you can expend 1,000 feet of movement to move up or down one Plane of Movement (doing so also moves you 500 feet forward in your cone of movement). When you target ships in other planes of movement, they are treated as being an additional 500 feet away for each plane of movement between your ship and the target. Two ships can pass above or below one another in the same space while in different planes of movement.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/ship-combat-quote.png","_id":"UQNQYKkOEK3Ginsf"}

The Captain, Dogfighter, and Engineer roles are optional; a captain provides extra actions to the crew, the engineer manages power flow and shields, and a dogfighter detaches from the main ship to target the weak points on enemy craft.</p>\n<h2>Initiative</h2>\n<p>When ship combat begins, each character must take a role on the ship to participate. A character's actions with regards to the ship are limited to the role they choose. Entire enemy ships act on a single turn of the initiative order, whereas individual characters act separately. However, if a character is in the role of the Captain, the entire crew can act on a single turn of the initiative order.</p>\n<h2>Character Roles</h2>\n<p>Each character on a starship chooses one of the following roles when they roll initiative. Depending on the ship, some roles, such as Gunner, might be occupied by one character, more than one character, or might not exist at all. By contrast, roles like Pilot are usually occupied only by one character.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A character can switch roles with another character or can switch to an unoccupied role as an action.</p>\n<h3>Captain</h3>\n<p>As the captain, you direct the ship's operations and manage the crew. If you choose to be the captain when the ship rolls initiative, you roll initiative for the entire ship. The entire party acts on that turn in the initiative order while you are captain, and you can choose in which order the crew members take their turns. If you leave the Captain role or fall unconscious, the party rolls initiative separately at the end of the next initiative order.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a captain, you can use the following actions:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Boarding Party</em></strong>. When the conditions for Boarding are met, you can use your action as the captain to form a boarding party (which you can choose to be a part of) and deploy the umbilicus.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong><em>Brace for Impact</em></strong>. You can use your action to brace the ship for damage. Each time your ship takes damage before the beginning of your next turn, you can roll 1d6 and subtract the number rolled from the mega damage your ship takes, to a minimum of 1.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div title=\"Page 194\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Deep Scan</strong></em>. If your ship is equipped with sensors, you can use your action to order a deep scan of a specific object of interest within range of the sensors. This allows you to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check to examine that object.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Fire at Will</strong></em>. You use your action to declare a barrage. One gunner of your choice can then use its reaction to make one attack with a ship weapon.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Full Speed Ahead</strong></em>. You use your action to push the engines. The pilot can then use its reaction to move the ship half its movement within the cone of movement.</p>\n<h3>Dogfighter</h3>\n<p>You deploy in a lighter, more maneuverable vessel to disable enemy fighters and target the vital locations of hostile ships. You can use your action to launch your fighter-sized ship from the main ship or to dock with it while you are adjacent to it. You can only switch roles while your fighter is docked with the main ship.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once launched, you can move your fighter's entire speed on its turn and use your action to fire its weapons. Movement and weapon attacks follow the same rules<br />as the Pilot&rsquo;s Move action and the Gunner&rsquo;s Open Fire action, except that moving your fighter doesn't require an action. You can also take the Pilot&rsquo;s Dogfighting action.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your fighter drops to 0 hit points and is destroyed, you can use your reaction to eject from the craft in a life pod to survive the explosion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While acting as a dogfighter, you can take the following special action:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Targeted Attack</strong></em>. While you are within 1,000 feet of another ship, you can use your action to attempt to disable one of that ship&rsquo;s systems. When you do so, make an attack targeting the ship with disadvantage. On a hit, you deal damage directly to a system of your choice, a weapon of your choice, or the ship&rsquo;s impulse engines. If the attack is blocked by a shield, the damage is subtracted from the target ship&rsquo;s shield points before it damages any system. Systems, weapons, and engines have 10 mega hit points each. Damage to systems is also deducted from the target ship&rsquo;s hit points.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a system or weapon drops to 0 hit points, it is disabled. Any creature operating a weapon when it is destroyed takes normal damage (as opposed to mega damage) equal to the damage dealt. If the engines drop to 0 hit points, the ship is crippled and can only move at half speed.</p>\n<h3>Engineer</h3>\n<p>As the engineer, you can direct power around the ship and position the ship's directional shield. By default, the shield is forward-facing and active.</p>\n<p>The ship's shield covers only one of the ship's four sides. As a bonus action, you can switch the direction the shield faces. If an attack hits the ship on its shielded side, damage is subtracted from the ship's shield points, rather than its hit points.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the initiative order, the shield regains half its maximum shield points, rounded up.</p>\n<p>As an engineer, you have the following actions available to you:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Directing Power</strong></em>. You can use your action to deactivate the shield and direct its power elsewhere: either to the impulse engines or into one of the ship&rsquo;s weapons. If you invest the power in the ship&rsquo;s engines, the ship&rsquo;s movement speed increases by half until the beginning of your next turn. If you invest the power in one of the ship&rsquo;s weapons, a gunner can make one additional attack using that weapon when they take the Open Fire action.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can draw power from the ship&rsquo;s weapons and invest it in the ship's shields. When you do so, until the beginning of your next turn, the ship's shields&nbsp;cover two of its consecutive sides, instead of only one, and it regains all of its shield points at the beginning of the initiative order, instead of only half. In exchange, each gunner makes one weapon attack fewer than normal when they take the Open Fire action.</p>\n<div title=\"Page 195\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<p><em><strong>Overcharge</strong></em>. If you are a spellcaster, you can use your action to expend a spell slot with a level greater than or equal to the Dark Matter engine's class to overcharge the engine. The shield recharges completely, and until the beginning of your next turn, power is invested in the ship&rsquo;s engines (increasing the ship&rsquo;s movement speed by half) and every gun (allowing each gunner to make one additional attack using that weapon when they take the Open Fire action on their turn). Once you use this ability, you can&rsquo;t use it again for 1 minute.</p>\n<p><em><strong>System Repair</strong></em>. You can use your action to repair a ship system or weapon that has 0 hit points and is deactivated. When you do so, make a DC 15 Intelligence (Technology) check. On a success, the system or weapon regains 1 mega hit point and reactivates at the beginning of your next turn.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Void Jump</strong></em>. You can begin the charging process for a void jump. Once a Dark Matter engine has begun to charge, it will jump in 1 minute. No intervention can stop or slow this process; once it is begun, nothing short of destroying the ship can interrupt the jump. The pilot is responsible for guiding the ship on the jump itself and rolls on the Jump Navigation table when the jump begins.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div title=\"Page 196\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h3>Gunner&nbsp;</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div title=\"Page 194\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div title=\"Page 196\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Acquiring targets and calculating ranges, you fire the shipboard weapons on hostile targets.

On its turn, a ship moves 1 square for every 500 feet of its movement.</p>\n<p>When counting distance on a grid, the first diagonal square counts as 1 square of movement, and the second diagonal square as 2 squares. Repeat this pattern of 1 square, 2 squares whenever you count diagonally, even if you move horizontally or vertically between different bits of movement.</p>\n<div title=\"Page 198\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h3>Variant Rule: Planes of Movement</h3>\n<p>Though ship combat primarily takes place on a 2D plane, you can use this variant rule to convert combat into a semblance of 3D space. When combat begins, the GM decides how many Planes of Movement exist. In open space, there might be three to four, while in orbit around a star, there may only be two.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>When moving your ship, you can expend 1,000 feet of movement to move up or down one Plane of Movement (doing so also moves you 500 feet forward in your cone of movement). When you target ships in other planes of movement, they are treated as being an additional 500 feet away for each plane of movement between your ship and the target. Two ships can pass above or below one another in the same space while in different planes of movement.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/ship-combat-quote.png","_id":"qIvrVCOfvq6zkXDu"}
{"name":"DM Appendix E: Hazards","permission":{"default":0,"PmXouJxFyK2lSXOA":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.UCJdFLoVKKwj7WqG"}},"content":"<h1>Appendix E: Hazards</h1>\n<p>While spaceflight can be tricky and downright dangerous, it&rsquo;s not quite the suicidal venture some make it out to be. With the right gear, the right ship, and the right crew, you&rsquo;re almost guaranteed to make it from your initial port of call to wherever you&rsquo;re heading, barring some unforeseen circumstances.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; That said, below are listed a number of potential hazards that could adversely affect your ability to get around the &lsquo;verse:</p>\n<h2>Dead Magic Zone</h2>\n<p>Where the edges of space wear thin, the fabric of magic has torn, leaving immense Dead Magic Zones in space where no arcana can exist. These regions behave much like antimagic zones and influence magical technology in the same way as magic items. Additionally, constructs within the zones are paralyzed, even if they would otherwise be immune to this condition.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; Vect, as living constructs, are not fully disabled within a Dead Magic Zone, but develop stutters in their voices and movement, and gain a level of exhaustion which can&rsquo;t be removed while they remain in the zone.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; Ships can no longer move, and all their systems and weapons are fully disabled. Thankfully, even void crystals fall inert, or the resulting shutdown of the ship&rsquo;s Dark Matter engine would be catastrophic. Gnomish technology, which is built on scientific principles, can operate normally in Dead Magic Zones.</p>\n<h2>Extreme Temperature</h2>\n<p>Few places in the galaxy are a comfortable temperature for organic life. The Black is an endless icy nothingness, whereas stars are universally scorching hellscapes; the friendly bands between these extremes, where organic life can comfortably exist, are few and far-between. Very hot and very cold terrestrial temperatures generally call for creatures to make Constitution saving throws (the DC varying based upon the temperature) to avoid exhaustion and other hazards, such as frostbite and sunburns. However, extreme temperatures, such as those found in space, are immediately life threatening.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; At the beginning of its turn, an unprotected creature exposed to extreme cold or extreme heat takes 1d6 cold or fire damage, respectively. If still exposed at the beginning of its next turn, the creature takes 2d6 damage, and 3d6 damage at the beginning of the turn following that, and so on, up to a maximum of 10d6. Even more extreme temperatures will begin damage with a higher number of damage dice, at the GM's discretion.</p>\n<h2>N-Virus</h2>\n<p>The N-Virus is a magical disease which affects only constructs and can lay dormant in machines for some time. Living constructs, such as vect and android characters, are particularly vulnerable, as the virus completely overwrites their personalities as it runs its course.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; If a construct comes in physical contact with a construct infected with the virus or uses an arcane terminal or other device infected with it, it must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become infected. Symptoms are minor at first, consisting of malfunctions and instances of faulty logic, but as the virus moves to dominate the construct's core, the virus reveals its true nature. The virus intelligently delays its progression, lying dormant for up to 30 days, until more constructs are infected or the infected construct has escaped quarantine.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; A construct with the N-Virus develops a fiendish intelligence and the sinister obsession of spreading the virus further. The construct's Intelligence score becomes 16 if it were lower. An infected character&rsquo;s alignment becomes chaotic evil, and it gains the following ideal: &ldquo;I will spread the N-Virus at all costs.&rdquo; The GM can take control of the character until the virus is removed. Additionally, an infected construct gains the ability to instill faults within machines, gaining the following trait:</p>\n<p>&nbsp; <strong><em>Innate Spellcasting</em></strong>. The infected construct&rsquo;s innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Intelligence modifier). The construct can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:</p>\n<p>&nbsp; At will:<em> @Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.spells.iYy45F5DU44zHtyS]{Technomancy}<br /></em>&nbsp; 3/day each: <em>@Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.spells.1ij2fHMyS59YyAMq]{Circuit Breaker}, @Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.spells.5r1sXVUPLHZF0RGS]{Perception Hack}, @Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.spells.zvpGryu96V628cDl]{Technical Difficulties}<br /></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp; The N-Virus can be prevented with the&nbsp;<em>@Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.spells.AddqDjJ6UHgyEVh2]{Antivirus} </em>spell. It can be cured with the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.F0GsG0SJzsIOacwV]{Lesser Restoration} spell while it lays dormant, but once it progresses, it can only be cured with a @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.WzvJ7G3cqvIubsLk]{Greater Restoration} spell, or similar magic, or if the character is killed and returned to life.</p>\n<h2>Radiation</h2>\n<p>Even brief exposure to hazardous radiation can kill, as evidenced by the bursts of radiant energy produced by blasters, but prolonged exposure can be just as deadly. A creature that spends one minute exposed to radiation must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for one hour. While poisoned, the creature's hit point maximum is decreased by 5. Each subsequent failed saving throw against radiation while the creature is poisoned increases the duration the creature is poisoned by an additional hour and decreases its hit point maximum by an additional 5. If a creature&rsquo;s hit point maximum is reduced to 0, it dies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; Lastly, when a creature that has been poisoned due to radiation recovers from being poisoned, roll a d20. On a 1, the creature suffers a severe side effect from the poisoning: an aneurysm or a cancerous growth. The creature's hit point maximum is halved until it is healed by a&nbsp;<em>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.WzvJ7G3cqvIubsLk]{Greater Restoration} </em>spell or similar magic.</p>\n<h2>Roach Addiction</h2>\n<p>Long term consumption of @Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.equipment.yOPaqdgXVT8z6vDC]{Ocoulori Radavitis}, also known as \"roaches\", is addictive and dangerous. Roaches are sentient and psychic creatures, and their violent deaths gradually wear down the psyche of those who eat them. When a creature consumes a roach, it must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it becomes addicted and gains one randomly-determined @Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.rolltables.JfQLnO61Sc9ZMYWb]{Indefinite Madness} trait. While addicted, it gains a level of exhaustion whenever it goes longer than 7 days without consuming a roach. Each time it fails this Wisdom save, it gains an additional Indefinite Madness trait and the time before exhaustion sets in decreases by 1 day, to a minimum of 1 day. Addiction can be ended by a <em>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl]{Remove Curse}</em> spell and its lingering madness traits can be cured by a <em>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.WzvJ7G3cqvIubsLk]{Greater Restoration}</em> spell or similar magic.</p>\n<h2>Vacuum</h2>\n<p>The vacuum of space is the apex of hazards; its extreme temperature and complete absence of air are universally lethal. No creature can hold its breath in a vacuum. Upon entering a vacuum without a breathing apparatus, a creature can survive a number of rounds equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum 2 rounds). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hits points and is dying.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; A creature with a breathing apparatus might still be subject to Extreme Temperature if it doesn't have other protective equipment.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; Casting a spell with a verbal component is impossible in a vacuum.</p>\n<h2>Variable Gravity</h2>\n<p>Though it&rsquo;s natural to take gravitational forces for granted while on a planet or within a ship with artificial gravity, the &lsquo;verse abounds with different gravitational environments, each of which pose a unique challenge to spacers and explorers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; <em>Zero Gravity</em>. Whenever a ship loses its life support system while in the Black or someone decides to go on a spacewalk, they experience zero gravity. In zero gravity environments, creatures and objects hang in the air until they are moved. A creature in zero gravity can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. Its speed is otherwise reduced to zero. Once a creature or object is set into motion, it can&rsquo;t stop moving until it collides with an obstacle. A creature automatically continues its movement at the same speed at the beginning of its turn, and an object set in motion moves with the same speed each round after it was moved.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; Creatures and objects in an area of zero gravity have no weight, but still may require some strength to push.</p>\n<p><em>&nbsp; Low Gravity</em>. Planetoids, asteroids, and moons with any sort of gravity will have low gravity, which only tenuously draws objects to the surface after allowing them to linger in the air for some time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; In low gravity, the weight of all creatures and objectsis halved. A creature in low gravity can jump twice the normal height and distance. Additionally, a creature takes half damage from falling in low gravity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; <em>High Gravity</em>. High gravity conditions are common in the &lsquo;verse, as it is the default environment for large and dense planets, though it also occurs whenever a ship strays too close to a massive object, such as a star or a black hole.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; Each creature in an area of high gravity area must spend two feet of movement for every foot moved, including flying, jumping, and climbing movement. This can be combined with difficult terrain to slow movement to a quarter of normal speed. If a prone creature wishes to stand up, it must succeed on a DC 12 Strength check. On a failure, it can&rsquo;t move at all on its turn.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; Objects in the area, including those being worn or carried, weigh double their usual weight, which therefore may cause creatures to become encumbered or cause loadbearing spells like levitate to fail. Creatures and objects take double damage from falling.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; <em>Extreme Gravity</em>. While high gravity can be tolerated for some time, extreme gravity is outright lethal. Extreme gravity carries all the penalties of high gravity, but a creature makes all Strength and Dexterity ability checks and saving throws with disadvantage. Additionally, at the beginning of its turn, a creature in extreme gravity takes bludgeoning damage based on its size: a Small creature takes 1d4 bludgeoning damage, a Medium creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage, a Large creature takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage, a Huge creature takes 1d10 bludgeoning damage, and a Gargantuan creature takes 1d12 bludgeoning damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","img":"","_id":"YIKHDbgjNY4sfx1m"}
