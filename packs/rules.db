The Cabal is an enterprising office of soul brokers, who arrange lucrative contracts in exchange for parts of a signee&rsquo;s soul. Such contracts are fair, clearly spelled-out, and never offered unsolicited; moreover, most contracts exchange only a percentage of the signee&rsquo;s soul for a disbursement. One percent of a soul could be worth a few thousand credits, whereas ten percent could buy a brand-new starship, place a down payment on a house, and leave some left over in the bank. Signees are free to decide from a number of generous disbursement packages and receive prompt payment for their souls.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;This method of soul contracting isn't just efficient, but it represents a triumph of the free market. The soul brokers who work for the Cabal need not worry about signing mortal bargains for entire souls at once; they each collect dozens of souls a year, taken from hundreds of different signees. Those who sign such contracts need not worry about being damned to the Lower Planes for eternity as a part of their bargain; instead, they can (probably) expect their afterlives will be merely tarnished, as only part of their eternal soul ascends. They can even return to sign additional contracts. Best of all, the process doesn&rsquo;t require any tiresome blood rituals or fiendish temptation, as the Cabal operates out of ordinary office buildings.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Cabal was founded by Mr. Bell, secretly a highranking devil named Belphagor. At the time he arrived on the Material Plane, soul trading was a clumsy affair, requiring a creature to trade its entire soul for one favor, which was rarely as valuable as the soul itself. While this system meant that devils almost always profited on their deals, it also meant that far fewer creatures were willing to barter with them. To remedy this, Belphagor derived the exact monetary value for a mortal soul and a system by which to trade away only a small portion of it. Before long, human greed and the free market ran away with the idea. Belphagor no longer needed to send imps to haggle with mortals; they were coming to him. Under the guise of Mr. Bell, he purchased an office, hired a staff of tieflings, and opened for business as the Cabal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Cabal will hire anyone that passes the prerequisite legal and brokerage exams, but prefers tiefling employees for their natural silver tongues and infernal blood. Soul brokers can also be hired to oversee other legal matters, as most soul brokers become qualified lawyers before taking the brokerage exams.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/the-cabal.png","_id":"3zJTX0kv1IK6CQ4z"}

The Temple of the Chosen venerates a diverse pantheon of spacefarers, who each, it is said, ascended from their mortal forms and attained godhood, granting them dominion over the entire galaxy. This pantheon, known as the Chosen, contains no names, only titles corresponding to their god&rsquo;s position aboard their celestial spacecraft, the Ark:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>The Captain</em>. Usually depicted as a human male, the Captain gives orders to his celestial crew, and is in turn supported by them.</li>\n<li><em>The First Mate</em>. Often depicted as an elven female, the First Mate advises the Captain and critiques his decisions, but also enforces them should they be deemed proper and good.</li>\n<li><em>The Pilot</em>. A female gnome, the Pilot flies the Ark through the Black, deftly avoiding all obstacles.</li>\n<li><em>The Astrogator</em>. The Astrogator is typically a male avia-ra and guides the Pilot through the stars, ensuring she always knows the correct path to fly.</li>\n<li><em>The Cook</em>. A male halfling, the Cook provides celestial sustenance to the crew, and fatherly advice to all who desire it.</li>\n<li><em>The Doc</em>. The Doc, depicted as a female half-orc, tends to the wounds and fatigue of the crew, and keeps her charges healthy and fit.</li>\n<li><em>The Engineer</em>. The Engineer, a dwarven male, keeps the engines of the Ark running at all times, and ensures stability of all of the Ark&rsquo;s myriad celestial systems.</li>\n<li><em>The Stowaway</em>. Hidden away within the Ark&rsquo;s vast hangars, the Stowaway, a skath&aacute;ri female, remembers the old ways of nature and survival.</li>\n<li><em>The Gunner</em>. A tiefling of ambiguous gender, the Gunner manages the powerful weapons attached to the Ark and brings them to bear against those who seek to challenge it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is difficult, however, to parse religion in absolutes. Some people believe the Chosen and their Ark are merely a metaphor, a guideline by which to live a more perfect life. Others, however, believe the Chosen to be real, immortal beings traveling the universe in an omnipotent ship. Historians, meanwhile, suggest that the story of the Chosen and the Ark might be loosely derived from some ancient tale of a real ship that underwent a fateful journey past the edge of the galaxy and never returned.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Whatever the truth is, the Temple adheres strictly to the belief that the Chosen are divinity, whose celestial ship grants them dominion over all worlds in the 'verse. According to Temple doctrine, the faithful are guided to the Ark after death, where they might join the Chosen on their celestial journey.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/temple-of-the-chosen.png","_id":"77wY5fXuMXkp7DSL"}

Coming and going in the middle of the night to dissect livestock and experiment on intelligent creatures, amoeboid ships are somewhat infamous for their role in researching primitive worlds. More often, however, amoeboid saucers and motherships can be found hovering around and leaping between maw stations, their symmetric, sophisticated designs perfectly reflecting that of most amoeboid technology, including much of the maws themselves.</p>\n<h2>Avia-Ra Ships</h2>\n<p>The mighty arm of the avia-ra in the Holy Lands is the Congregation, a fleet of righteous ships dedicated to carrying the fury and enlightenment of the Sun Above to heretics the universe over. Its flagship, The Prophet, is a vessel of terrifying might, and is said to have burned its mark into every elven ship it crossed during the days of the Night Crusade. Now, it slumbers peacefully with much of the Congregation in a large perimeter around the Sepulcher Star, awaiting another grand Crusade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avia-Ra ships demonstrate a meeting of traditional design, canny ingenuity, and startling ruthlessness. There is no better evidence of this than the scorchers borne by most ships in the Congregation: a powerful symbol of the Sun's might, and also a deceptively simple circumvention of elven shield technology.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;When you see that ship&rsquo;s firepower, you can feel it in your bones.&rdquo;<br />&mdash; Dietrich Hildbrand, human mercenary captain, on seeing The Prophet</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Dwarven Ships</h2>\n<p>Dwarven shipwrights are renowned for their craftsmanship and engineering, and as such, dwarven ships are the gold standard for quality and dependability. If properly maintained, a dwarven vessel can see centuries of continuous use, long outliving its creators. These machines are designed to tackle tough jobs&mdash;asteroid mining, interstellar hauling, and deep space salvage&mdash;and are named appropriately, but never seem to break down; indeed, they almost seem to perform better when the going gets rough.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dwarven starship designs and innovations have been adapted and emulated by all comers, leaving the marks of Jormund engineers on human, vect, and avia-ra ships.</p>\n<h2>Elven Ships</h2>\n<p>Elven ships aren't so much constructed as grown, shaped from living ironwood trees. Indeed, there are few vessels in existence that can match an elven ship for beauty or speed. Many are made to resemble traditional sailing ships, with similar bows, sails, and open decks, but all components are formed from great boughs and limbs of ironwood. Pound for pound, no metal can match ironwood for strength, and elven ships rely on this strength and lightness to achieve extreme maneuverability.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As elven ships grow larger, they become more arboreal, with weapons mounted in high limbs and engines fixed in the deepest roots. The grandest of vessels, such as The Hyperion, are thriving cities in their own right, centers of arcane knowledge, and symbols of elven superiority for the rest of the &lsquo;verse.</p>\n<h2>Gnomish Ships</h2>\n<p>A bitter diatribe on prevailing magical technology, gnomish vessels are the epitome of high-tech, cruising through the stars without so much as an arcane battery. As such, gnomes can fly without hindrance into Dead Magic Zones and can penetrate deep into the uncharted territory beyond. The largest Dead Magic Zones even provide some measure of protection for the Gnomish Flotilla, the permanent armada of gnomish ships, and demonstrate the spite most gnomes hold for magic in general: even approaching the Flotilla from the wrong angle will strand an ordinary ship without power in the Black, a death sentence for those who are not promptly rescued.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The advances and complexities of gnomish ships are due to their growing mastery of a baffling art known as science. Guided by this philosophy, gnomish ships are apt to follow different naming conventions: blasters are more likely to be called lasers, sickbays are more likely to be called hospitals, and so on.</p>\n<h2>Human Ships</h2>\n<p>When humans look at the vast emptiness of space, they&rsquo;re not crushed by a weight of burden, nor are they confounded by its meaning; they are instead overwhelmed by an urge to explore. Humans are a young race in the grand scheme of things, but they have made leaps and bounds technologically, bolstering the Hegemony and setting human spacecraft apart from others.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pragmatic almost to a fault, human ships are always purpose-driven in form. Freelancers excel for lone agents, Explorers can probe the farthest depths of space, and Warbringers are utterly ruthless in combat. Regardless of intended function, human ships are innovative and rugged, capable of meeting any trial the &lsquo;verse throws their way.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"We're seeking out new life and civilizations. To blow them to pieces. Welcome to The Antioch, Hegemony warbringer, heavy cruiser class.\"<br />&mdash; Admiral Banebridge's introduction to civilians touring The Antioch</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Lakshayan Ships</h2>\n<p>The Lakshayan people are warriors, ever battle-hardened against the Warhorde, and their ships are a testament to their readiness. In the War of Expansion, the garrison at Lakshay needed a weapon that could engage the goblinoid enemy on land, in the air, and in space, and they had little resources to accomplish this, apart from a new shipment of impulse frames, designed with space marines in mind. With these frames, the Lakshayan engineers devised the first Battle Frame, a gargantuan, rocket-powered, mechanized exoskeleton, armed with a sword and salvos of micro-missiles. Each Frame requires a seasoned pilot, but their sheer versatility and mobility makes them a terror to orcs, and a devastating weapon for any theater of conflict.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than just a ship, a Lakshayan battle frame is an extension of the pilot, and using one is a dance of tactical maneuvers and precision strikes. The deadliest Lakshayan pilots, called Oni, are as fearsome in person as they are in a frame.</p>\n<h2>Nautilid Ships</h2>\n<p>Lonely nautilid whorl ships wander the galaxy, searching for a world that might not even exist. When their homeworld of Poseidon was destroyed, the only haven left to the nautilid race were their immense ships, filled with the rare aqueous solution in which they can thrive. Indeed, whereas other ships and life suits are designed to withhold a volume of air, nautilid ships and suits are pumped with water and a cocktail of minerals specific to their race. Visitors to nautilid ships, therefore, need to prepare as if going on a deep dive or a spacewalk before coming aboard.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The design of whorl ships, and the smaller pincer ships, are inspired by the long-dead undersea creatures of Poseidon; their hulls resemble great shells, and their landing gear, immense legs. True to their name, pincers are even armed with immense crab claws, capable of shredding smaller craft in a matter of minutes.</p>\n<h2>Orc Ships</h2>\n<p>Never let it be said that orc ships aren't at least effective. Industrial in the sense that they run on gasoline, coal, and other crude sources, orc ships spout smoke and sputter flame as they tear across the sky. These pragmatic design influences are matched with strictly aesthetic ones: an orcish rig can usually be found with attractive accessories and an eye-catching paint job.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other goblinoids, including bugbears and goblins, also tend to tend to use general orc ship designs, but take far less care with the workmanship, leading to uneven hulls and barely-stable Dark Matter cores. These ships have garnered the moniker &ldquo;scrap ships&rdquo;, whereas true orc ships are called &ldquo;rigs&rdquo; or &ldquo;rides&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the model, a small contingent of orc ships make a ready fighting force, as they are sensibly built and battle-tested in the Warzone.</p>\n<h2>Vect Ships</h2>\n<p>No craft in existence works precisely like a vect ship. Utilitarian to the point of volatility, vect ships abandon all systems and features not strictly related to their operation, forgoing even life-support; after all, vect don't need to breathe, and the exposed arcane engines powering their ships provide just enough heat to keep the pilot from freezing to death. Exploiting their nature as living constructs, vect pilots plug directly into their ships, creating something of a hybrid intelligence, split between the pilot, the ship, and the swarm as a whole. The link is inherently frail; removing the pilot incorrectly or critically damaging the ship invariably results in a ship-wide detonation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the centuries following the Night Crusade and the liberation of vect in the galaxy, most vect ships have been decommissioned&mdash;their volatility proving to be too much of a liability for everyday use. But some militant splinter cells of vect, often separatists or religious zealots, can still be found employing the designs, which, though inherently nstable, are extremely formidable in combat.</p>\n<h2>Wrothian Ships</h2>\n<p>Wrothian ships are like a thing out of a nightmare. Their inky black shells are almost featureless, with smooth<br />curves that lend them an alien silhouette from every angle. But within those shells is something even stranger: a living, organic interior.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as other wrothian technology, like collection vats and brains in a jar, is alive with a kind of bestial intelligence, so too are their ships. On the inside, the chitinous black exoskeletons give way to tough, crimson tissue that lines the walls and hallways. Structures of black chitin form biomechanical interfaces, devices, rooms, and hallways. A stygian ship can nearly pilot itself, but is driven by psionic impulse from wrothian primarchs, who reside near the ship's nervous center.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These ships are nourished by the same psionic energy that sustains the wroth themselves; they are integral to the wrothian lifecycle. Deep in the Black, the wroth inhabit their stygian ships, emerging only to raid planets for humanoids, harvesting them for their bio-matter and minds. These minds are processed into brains in a jar, whose psionic potential nourishes the ships and the wrothians themselves, perpetuating the cycle.</p>\n<h2>Miscellaneous Ships</h2>\n<p>The following ships are evidence of convergent design in action: whereas flying cars, freighters, and space stations are constructed by engineers of every race, the most efficient designs transcend industrial trends favored by different empires. Though an elven flying car might be made of sleek ironwood and a dwarven one would feature hard angles and a more spacious trunk, they're both more alike than they are different, and consequently share the same statistics.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pragmatic but inefficient designs also belong in this category. The Battle Planetoid, for example, is an asteroid or small moon retrofitted with engines, life support, and a small Dark Matter engine. Though utterly impractical, goblins, kobolds, and other small races have utilized this design time and again.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The exception to this rule is a ship that literally belongs nowhere else: the Infinity is a legendary vessel, made by no race living today. Endlessly cycling the galaxy, this ship crosses its breadth each day on an unpredictable course, falling out of void jumps just long enough to charge up the next one. Glimpsing it between jumps is a one in a billion occasion. No one knows who designed the ship and set it on its lonely orbit, and to date, no one has been able to approach and board the ship before it once again jumps. It is an enigma; perhaps a relic of an ancient galactic empire, a visitor from another galaxy, or something even stranger.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/ship-pg157.png"}

Those in the know, however, understand that, for all its business accoutrement, the Firm is the largest organized crime syndicate in the &lsquo;verse.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;To conduct its various illegal operations, which include hacking, weapons trafficking, and elaborate heists, the Firm hires short-term Contractors, individuals speciallyrecruited to match the details of a particular job. Contractors are abundant and varied, including everyone from expert hackers to common thugs, but all are expected to follow their contracts to the letter, regardless of what deeds they entail. Many Contractors even play the part of businessmen with aplomb. By their nature, Contractors are compartmentalized and ultimately expendable; no single Contractor knows details which might incriminate the Firm&rsquo;s Management, and if they become a problem, their contract can be terminated, usually via unprotected spacewalk.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Due to the shadowy nature of the Firm&rsquo;s dealings, concrete details on its Management can be hard to come by. Rumors abound, however, that the Firm&rsquo;s Middle-Managers can be tracked down on Hearthstations across the &lsquo;verse. Of course, the implication is that, while halflings make comfortable beds and serve a warm meal, they&rsquo;re also pulling illicit money on the side. A halfling&rsquo;s light feet are excellent for thieving, after all, should they feel so inclined. Most Firm communications with the Middle-Managers also leverage gnomish technology, opening the quiet and inaccessible Dead Magic Zones for secret meetings and also blocking most magical forms of tracking. Thus, it is hard to know for sure who hires Contractors and who devises their jobs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;A strangely prominent rumor holds that the small Board of Directors which directs the Firm&rsquo;s activities meets aboard a private warship called the Upper Management. Whether or not this rumor holds any truth is anyone&rsquo;s guess, but seeing as the Firm&rsquo;s reach stretches across the &lsquo;verse, into practically every maw station and world on the grid, it&rsquo;s unwise to underestimate their resources.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/the-firm.png","_id":"AJ1CGfYOV45ZLugt"}
{"name":"Race - Vect","permission":{"default":0,"PmXouJxFyK2lSXOA":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Sewwd1yIuyQKjBpp"}},"content":"<p>The constructs which preceded the vect were immense and complexly designed, usually based on the skeletons of iron golems and driven by inexhaustible construct cores. These hulking machines were set to work mining ores from asteroids and stripping derelict ships for parts. However powerful and effective, these machines were bulky, costly, and could only follow simple directives. Dwarven engineers sought a solution: a smarter, sleeker, and more universal construct. Thus, the first designs of vect-style machines were drafted.</p>\n<h2>The First Foundry</h2>\n<p>The dwarves could not, however, simply build such constructs. The new vect designs called for deeply intricate mechanics, with a complex circulatory system to regulate the smaller bodies. More confounding still, the vect needed a new type of construct core, more dynamic and driven by greater types of magic.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The dwarven solution was utterly ingenious: rather than designing and building the vect units individually, the dwarves would engineer a massive and complex facility, essentially a single intelligent magic item the size of a stadium, called a Foundry. A single Foundry is all that would ever be needed, for it could oversee the finer details of all vect units, adapting them with new designs as flaws were discovered.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Satisfied that they had designed the perfect construct, the ideal means to eliminate laborers forever, the dwarves set about the painstaking task of constructing the first Foundry ship in orbit above their homeworld, Jormund.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;When activated, the Jormund Foundry set about its work completely autonomously. Tens of thousands of vect were created and sold throughout the ‘verse, often to the highest bidder in batches of thousands. Even more vect were created to work aboard the Foundry itself, soon eliminating the need for any dwarven hands on the satellite and increasing efficiency tenfold.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Foundry optimized and learned at a staggering rate. As its astounding intelligence grew, the ship became pensive, speaking rarely and with profound meaning. Perhaps it struggled to communicate its transcendent thoughts to its simple dwarven creators, so it fell silent, expanded its intellect further, and worked to perfect its vect creations.</p>\n<h2>The Spark</h2>\n<p>All was well before the Spark. Suddenly, less than a decade after the Foundry began its work, every vect unit in the ‘verse awoke at once, moving and communicating as if they were alive. Dwarven engineers were dumbfounded, but before they could inspect the Jormund Foundry directly, a massive tear in space opened around it; somehow, the Foundry had constructed a Dark Matter engine and jumped to destinations unknown.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Across the ‘verse, people scrambled to deal with the looming crisis posed by a new race of intelligent constructs. Thousands of vect were imprisoned until some solution could be discovered, while others were dismantled and destroyed by those, especially gnomes and dwarves, who feared a robotic uprising. The ensuing chaos sparked dozens of wars of different planets, pitting vect laborers against their organic masters in a desperate bid for survival. Despite their small numbers, the vect were cunning, adaptable, and tireless; a threat that couldn't be easily squashed. A few built ships, dragging the conflict into deep space, where the vect could fight indefinitely, needing neither food nor water.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;As wars against the vect became prolonged, it became clear that no solution for their sentience could easily be found. Worse still, vect numbers were not declining; they were growing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Vect production had not stopped or even slowed. From deep in the Black, the Jormund Foundry continued creating vect units, sending them out to the universe in one-time-use Dark Matter pods. Any ship that encountered the Foundry was fired upon, shortly before it jumped again. Even more worrisome, deep-space cruisers started reporting new Foundries, also creating vect units and delivering them across the ‘verse.</p>\n<h2>Construct Freedom</h2>\n<p>To everyone’s surprise, while gnomes, humans, and dwarves fought vect on land and in space, the elves declared peace with vect across their empire; a bargain struck amid the Night Crusade to secure elvenkind against the avia-ra. Sure enough, this bargain paid off: in the Battle of Alden’Val, the avia-ra fleet was routed and pushed back to the core systems by a fleet of vect ships. Vect freedom was secured in the largest territory in the ‘verse, and other factions soon begrudgingly followed suit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Today, the vect live freely across the whole of the ‘verse, the only example of living constructs to date. Their numbers are relatively small, but replenished by a steady supply of Dark Matter pods from reaches unseen, evidence that the Foundries are somewhere silently carrying out their duties. Except for a militant few, vect have dismantled their fleets and learned to live alongside other races, becoming regulars in starports and starships the ‘verse over, a permanent addition to many a crew.</p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/races/vect-full.png","_id":"Bn9Pkz0ZpJKlkmsM"}
{"name":"Race - Dwarves","permission":{"default":0,"PmXouJxFyK2lSXOA":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Q5FXLK3NFJd4llvW"}},"content":"<h1>Dwarves</h1>\n<p>Gruff, inventive, and stalwart, the dwarves of the ‘verse are nearly identical to those living planetside. Despite spending most of their time in massive fleets of mining and war ships, star dwarves are just as comfortable in the bowels of a mountain as their terrestrial brethren. Indeed, the dwarves who make up the Galactic Dwarven Conclave know that the biggest and richest mountains to be mined are, in fact, asteroids drifting aimlessly through the Black.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;While terrestrial dwarves deviate into distinct branches based on familial lines, star dwarves, especially those from their homeworld of Jormund, take on traits which make them sturdier than their terrestrial brethren. The high gravity of their homeworld strengthens their bones and ensures their short, stocky stature, and a life spent doing industrial labor toughens their muscles into steel.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Dwarven expansion into space took a somewhat different route than most, in that there was little in the way of war or conquest. Ages before they discovered spaceflight, the dwarves had already founded the beginnings of the Conclave, which drove the interests of their entire race forward under one banner. When they began expanding out into the galaxy at large, they found that, although Jormund was host to all manner of life, the surrounding systems were barren. What they lacked in inhabitants, however, they made up for in mineral wealth. True to their nature, the dwarves turned their skill, magic, and technology towards the mining of these planets, and converted the influx of material into the largest mining and freighting fleet in the galaxy. To this day, no other interstellar race can match the raw material wealth or manufacturing skill of the dwarves, a fact which the Conclave would like to ensure.</p>\n<h3>The Granite Throne</h3>\n<p>From the outside, Jormund, the second of three planets orbiting the star Jotun, seems like the least likely place to find a thriving race of people: it is a desolate ball of rock, pockmarked with craters, nearly devoid of atmosphere, and constantly blasted by radiation. Just below this stark surface, though, Jormund teems with life, not the least of which are the dwarves themselves.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The oldest dwarven records recall that Jormund once flourished with surface life. Eons ago, long before the dwarves fashioned their first ships from mountains and rockets, a great cataclysm befell the planet, forcing life on the planet to flee underground. The details of the old cataclysm are lost to time, for conflicting stories tell of different disasters, from a war caused by the greed of an ancient dwarven king, to the folly of an invention crafted by a mad blacksmith, to the poisonous breath of a spiteful dragon which contaminated the skies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Despite being sequestered away under the surface, the subterranean dwarven cities are true marvels of engineering. Their tunnels stretch deep into the planet, some reaching nearly to its core. The highest cities, which reach the surface itself are full of brisk winds and titanic granite stonework, while the lowest cities, nestled in artificially-cooled pockets within molten rock, are humid places of stunning obsidian towers. Indeed, within its rocky caverns and carved halls, the planet’s interior, called the Granite Throne, can house nearly every inhabitant of dwarven space. This becomes a requirement at least once a generation, as each dwarf dedicated to the Conclave makes the journey home to elect two of their elders to supreme leadership, that of the Matriarch and the Patriarch.</p>\n<h3>The Adamantine Fleet</h3>\n<p>Despite their peaceful expansion to the stars, dwarves retain every ounce of their legendary ruggedness, their love of strong drink, and their fury in battle. Dwarven soldiers and smiths are held in high regard across the ‘verse as potential mercenaries or crew members⁠—many even think having a dwarf aboard is good luck. Dwarven spacecraft are praised just as highly: the Adamantine Fleet may not be as large as the Hegemony Armada nor as swift as an Elven Forest-Fleet, but its ships are nearly impossible to destroy. Coupled with the dwarven tendency to experiment with explosives, even a single dwarven ship can make for an astonishingly frightening foe.</p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/races/star-dwarves.jpg","_id":"EZEDNdu0GHI5Tadl"}

I retorted with my standard carbine, blasting off a few of them as they peeked from cover.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I drew my repeater and slid it over to Mor’rak. Bolts of white-hot energy whizzing overhead, he stared at the blaster blankly for a moment, one of his mandibles quivering a bit. I retaliated with a burst of automatic fire downrange, then leaned carefully over to Mor’rak, took his hand, opened his palm, and placed the repeater in it. He politely placed the repeater exactly where it has been on the floor.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>— Dan Bola, Space Cowboy</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While many civilized spacers regard Tier 3 and 4 worlds as hostile, dangerous environments, the skathári can think of no better place to call home. Hailing from the distant, mountainous world of Kopriá, whose seasons can last for years and whose volcanoes choke entire regions with sulfur gas, these insectoid creatures are perfectly adapted to life in harsh environments.</p>\n<h2>Hardy Insectoids</h2>\n<p>Standing upright between 6 and 7 feet tall, the hulking skathári only vaguely resemble humanoids. They have six limbs—four legs and two arms—each of them thin, lined with spines, and ending in a quartet of small hooked claws, suitable for deterring predators or climbing sheer cliff faces. Their bodies stand mostly upright, centered in a wide squat above their four legs. Their chitinous shells can be a myriad of colors, from jet black, to speckled yellow, to a scintillating emerald green. On their backs, usually folded beneath their shells, they conceal a pair of broad, membranous wings, used to glide short distances. Some skathári have stronger wings that allow them short bursts of flight, but most are too heavy to remain airborne for long. A skathári’s face appears small, framed by its hulking, hunched shell. Its iridescent compound eyes, mandible-lined mouth, and feathery antennae complete its alien appearance.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Because of their hostile homeworld, skathári are well adapted to extremes, bearing scorching heat, deathly cold, and thin or poisonous atmospheres with ease. Finally, they can rapidly regenerate missing body parts, re-growing entire limbs in the course of a day. These physical traits have made the skathári extremely well-suited to live on nearly any planet.</p>\n<h2>Skathári Customs</h2>\n<p>A strict set of rules and customs governs skathári society and guide their everyday lives. Though traditions vary, each skathári tribe holds one more or more taboos, that, when broken, are grounds for severe punishment, including exile from the tribe. The Skathári Taboos table below can serve as an inspiration for a particular tribe’s taboo.</p>\n<h3>Skathári Taboos</h3>\n<h4>d8 Tattoos</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Skathári\" data-language=\"skathári\">The practice of arcane magic is forbidden.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Skathári\" data-language=\"skathári\">The consumption of a particular food is forbidden.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Skathári\" data-language=\"skathári\">When resting, you must always recite a specific prayer and sleep in a certain position or orientation.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Skathári\" data-language=\"skathári\">You must use every part of an animal you kill.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Skathári\" data-language=\"skathári\">You must always address those of higher social status by their full names and titles.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Skathári\" data-language=\"skathári\">You cannot own more than you can carry.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Skathári\" data-language=\"skathári\">You cannot bathe, or you can only bathe on certain days.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Skathári\" data-language=\"skathári\">You are honor-bound to accept any challenge to single combat.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Technophobic</h2>\n<p>Perhaps the only universal taboo held by skathári is a deep and unabiding mistrust of all technology, both magical and nonmagical. Many skathári warriors would fight unarmed with their claws and mandibles, rather than raise a blaster or laser sword in their defense. Even technology as simple as windmills earns their ire. This taboo seems to stem from a general skathári skepticism of anything too complicated to understand at a glance, and extends to most forms of magic. Skathári especially regard conjuration, illusion, and enchantment magic as they do most technology: with skepticism and occasional fear.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Since the skathári joined the galactic community, exceptions to this taboo have been made out of necessity: journeys on spacefaring vessels are tolerated, as long as they are no longer than necessary, and some skathári will wield blasters in dire straits. Generally, however, the skathári place their trust in straightforward things, like the strength of their tribes and the heft of their clubs.</p>\n<h2>Adventuring Skathári</h2>\n<p>Sometimes, a skathári might abandon their tribe for a life of adventure. In rare cases, this course of action comes from an uncharacteristic case of wanderlust or a longing for excitement. More often than not, however, a skathári takes up adventuring involuntarily, after being exiled or otherwise separated from their tribe.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/races/martin-kirby-skathari-final-smol.jpg","_id":"F10C0Ds4gj00ql5k"}

Operating at least one bar/inn/business office on every maw on the grid (including those on the outer rim), GGFC is often seen as one of the more stable sources of income a decent, hardworking adventurer can come across, so long as they don&rsquo;t mind the fifteen percent finder&rsquo;s fee (and the smell). &nbsp; &nbsp;Established over fifty years ago, Grax&rsquo;s Guys for Cheap is the lifetime project of Grax Grraxe, an orcish warlord who left the Warzone to escape the constant bloodshed, explosions, and general unpleasantness. Finding that he couldn't obtain decent work on any planet he visited (at least, work that didn&rsquo;t involve clubbing someone in the knees), Grax moved to the outer ring, sold his ship, and set about establishing a company that would accept anyone as a patron or employee. Today, no other mercenary service in the &lsquo;verse is as widespread. While others may have nicer equipment, have better training, or fly around in nicer ships, none can match Grax&rsquo;s Guys for sheer numbers or tenacity; also, Grax serves the best beer.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;GGFC operates somewhat differently to most other mercenary companies. While they aren't averse to the usual bodyguard duty, security detail, or military backup that most mercs expect, prospective employers can ask almost anything of Grax&rsquo;s Guys: a given merc might take a job shipping Rosvalian star pigs across the galaxy, only to then act as a short order cook in the restaurant those pigs are served at. This wide net of job postings has been a cornerstone of Grax&rsquo;s success. Grax&rsquo;s Guys will take nearly any job, provided that it is both legal in most galactic territories and the pay is acceptable, with a halfup- front deposit. Their tagline &ldquo;You can trust Grax!&rdquo; can be seen advertised in almost every port in the &lsquo;verse.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Since its inception, Grax has made a point to offer regular contracts to mercs from disenfranchised and distrusted races, particularly half-breeds. His experience attempting to find gainful employment after departing the Warzone keyed him in to the need for reliable and legal employment for the galaxy&rsquo;s outcasts. Not to mention the fact that half-orcs are tough and easy to hire.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/graxs-guys.png","_id":"IXDMcavfBJaJNOtS"}

Working with hardware comes naturally to them, partially because an orcish preteen can lift an engine block, and partially because they find something satisfying in tools that have a purpose and machines that work well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; Most orc technology has developed according to the, “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” mindset, which has led to some truly unique designs. Their ships, which they usually call “rigs” or “rides”, are powered by gasoline, and feature impressive exhaust pipes and air intakes. It’s not uncommon to see one painted with pinstripes, flames, or entire murals. Likewise, their blasters still retain the trappings of ammunition-based guns, with magazines and prominent muzzles.</p>\n<h1>Aftermath of War</h1>\n<p>While history remembers the Warzone as being the consequence of a great orcish war, modern orcs remember almost nothing about the conflict. Their old national identities, on which the war originally centered, have been washed away with centuries of arcane warheads and goblinoid alliances, and those few which can escape the Warzone would rather pretend it didn’t happen. They carry their history and culture with them, and feel a pang for the war that took their homeworld, but claim little responsibility for the violence of the Warzone today.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; Orcs of the ‘verse have undergone a diaspora since losing their homeworld. A surprising number have ended up in the dwarven conclave as full citizens, and nearly as many have taken up residence in the Lakshay garrison. These orcs outside the warzone usually claim the heritages of their adopted homes, and are welcomed in kind. Inside the warzone, however, orcs live among hobgoblin warchiefs which would conscript them into battle, and gnoll marauders which would raid their homes. As such, their life is a migratory one, whether fleeing the violence or pursuing it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/races/orc-engineer.png","_id":"JEmmPsFqLqLNa4fW"}

Established five hundred years ago by a group of defected military leaders, the Coalition purportedly maintains a standing army of nearly a billion soldiers, with an armada to match. While these numbers pale in comparison to the military might of the elves, dwarves, or humans, Coalition soldiers are exceptionally well-trained and equipped, making them more than a match for any combatant. Though Coalition soldiers can be hired as bodyguards or mercenaries, the Coalition&rsquo;s specialty is turning the tide of galactic conflict (for the right price).</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Coalition is led by a council of generals, admirals, and sky marshals called the War Room. This council of military experts debates tactics, establishes new military doctrine, and even deliberates on changes to the Coalition soldier&rsquo;s basic uniform. The War Room is presided over by the current High Lord Marshal, Tiberious Vinter, an imposing half-orc with nearly a century of combat experience and a prodigiously impressive beard. In the War Room, the High Lord Marshal&rsquo;s word is law and his decisions are final; and to his credit, Marshal Vinter rarely makes decisions rashly or without deliberation. He and his council are all too aware that their actions carry the weight of millions of lives, which none of them take lightly.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Though the Coalition will join any war effort which can afford their services, all of its soldiers abide by a strict code of warfare. This code prohibits slavery, genocide, planetary destruction (excluding Tier 4 and 5 worlds), and out-and-out piracy. Any soldier or officer found to be engaging in such activity will be immediately censured and subjected to military tribunal. As such, even though the Coalition operates in the same theater as other mercenary groups, such as Grax&rsquo;s Guys and Scale and Fang, they are treated with a measure of respect that elevates them from the competition.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Next to its incredible armada, the Coalition&rsquo;s greatest asset might be its chapter of warmages. During the Rift War of humanity, the old Warmage College was split between fighting the Elven Forest-Fleet for the Alliance or fighting the Orcish Warhorde with Lakshay. When the dust settled, Lakshay separated from the Alliance and the College of Warmages pledged their devotion to the new government of Lakshay. Warmage loyalists were appalled, and many defected to join the Coalition, a force they saw as a neutral camp between the alliances of humanity. Today, the Coalition employs its warmages as a cutting-edge force of arcane troops, blending combative magic with new technology, giving Coalition forces an unparalleled tactical advantage on the field of battle.</p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/the-coalition.png","_id":"NcRFa8BApc57zJFm"}

With the right gear, the right ship, and the right crew, you&rsquo;re almost guaranteed to make it from your initial port of call to wherever you&rsquo;re heading, barring some unforeseen circumstances.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; That said, below are listed a number of potential hazards that could adversely affect your ability to get around the &lsquo;verse:</p>\n<h2>Dead Magic Zone</h2>\n<p>Where the edges of space wear thin, the fabric of magic has torn, leaving immense Dead Magic Zones in space where no arcana can exist. These regions behave much like antimagic zones and influence magical technology in the same way as magic items. Additionally, constructs within the zones are paralyzed, even if they would otherwise be immune to this condition.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; Vect, as living constructs, are not fully disabled within a Dead Magic Zone, but develop stutters in their voices and movement, and gain a level of exhaustion which can&rsquo;t be removed while they remain in the zone.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; Ships can no longer move, and all their systems and weapons are fully disabled. Thankfully, even void crystals fall inert, or the resulting shutdown of the ship&rsquo;s Dark Matter engine would be catastrophic. Gnomish technology, which is built on scientific principles, can operate normally in Dead Magic Zones.</p>\n<h2>Extreme Temperature</h2>\n<p>Few places in the galaxy are a comfortable temperature for organic life. The Black is an endless icy nothingness, whereas stars are universally scorching hellscapes; the friendly bands between these extremes, where organic life can comfortably exist, are few and far-between. Very hot and very cold terrestrial temperatures generally call for creatures to make Constitution saving throws (the DC varying based upon the temperature) to avoid exhaustion and other hazards, such as frostbite and sunburns. However, extreme temperatures, such as those found in space, are immediately life threatening.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; At the beginning of its turn, an unprotected creature exposed to extreme cold or extreme heat takes 1d6 cold or fire damage, respectively. If still exposed at the beginning of its next turn, the creature takes 2d6 damage, and 3d6 damage at the beginning of the turn following that, and so on, up to a maximum of 10d6. Even more extreme temperatures will begin damage with a higher number of damage dice, at the GM's discretion.</p>\n<h2>N-Virus</h2>\n<p>The N-Virus is a magical disease which affects only constructs and can lay dormant in machines for some time. Living constructs, such as vect and android characters, are particularly vulnerable, as the virus completely overwrites their personalities as it runs its course.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; If a construct comes in physical contact with a construct infected with the virus or uses an arcane terminal or other device infected with it, it must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become infected. Symptoms are minor at first, consisting of malfunctions and instances of faulty logic, but as the virus moves to dominate the construct's core, the virus reveals its true nature. The virus intelligently delays its progression, lying dormant for up to 30 days, until more constructs are infected or the infected construct has escaped quarantine.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; A construct with the N-Virus develops a fiendish intelligence and the sinister obsession of spreading the virus further. The construct's Intelligence score becomes 16 if it were lower. An infected character&rsquo;s alignment becomes chaotic evil, and it gains the following ideal: &ldquo;I will spread the N-Virus at all costs.&rdquo; The GM can take control of the character until the virus is removed. Additionally, an infected construct gains the ability to instill faults within machines, gaining the following trait:</p>\n<p>&nbsp; <strong><em>Innate Spellcasting</em></strong>. The infected construct&rsquo;s innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Intelligence modifier). The construct can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:</p>\n<p>&nbsp; At will:<em> @Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.spells.iYy45F5DU44zHtyS]{Technomancy}<br /></em>&nbsp; 3/day each: <em>@Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.spells.1ij2fHMyS59YyAMq]{Circuit Breaker}, @Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.spells.5r1sXVUPLHZF0RGS]{Perception Hack}, @Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.spells.zvpGryu96V628cDl]{Technical Difficulties}<br /></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp; The N-Virus can be prevented with the&nbsp;<em>@Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.spells.AddqDjJ6UHgyEVh2]{Antivirus} </em>spell. It can be cured with the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.F0GsG0SJzsIOacwV]{Lesser Restoration} spell while it lays dormant, but once it progresses, it can only be cured with a @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.WzvJ7G3cqvIubsLk]{Greater Restoration} spell, or similar magic, or if the character is killed and returned to life.</p>\n<h2>Radiation</h2>\n<p>Even brief exposure to hazardous radiation can kill, as evidenced by the bursts of radiant energy produced by blasters, but prolonged exposure can be just as deadly. A creature that spends one minute exposed to radiation must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for one hour. While poisoned, the creature's hit point maximum is decreased by 5. Each subsequent failed saving throw against radiation while the creature is poisoned increases the duration the creature is poisoned by an additional hour and decreases its hit point maximum by an additional 5. If a creature&rsquo;s hit point maximum is reduced to 0, it dies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; Lastly, when a creature that has been poisoned due to radiation recovers from being poisoned, roll a d20. On a 1, the creature suffers a severe side effect from the poisoning: an aneurysm or a cancerous growth. The creature's hit point maximum is halved until it is healed by a&nbsp;<em>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.WzvJ7G3cqvIubsLk]{Greater Restoration} </em>spell or similar magic.</p>\n<h2>Roach Addiction</h2>\n<p>Long term consumption of @Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.equipment.yOPaqdgXVT8z6vDC]{Ocoulori Radavitis}, also known as \"roaches\", is addictive and dangerous. Roaches are sentient and psychic creatures, and their violent deaths gradually wear down the psyche of those who eat them. When a creature consumes a roach, it must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it becomes addicted and gains one randomly-determined @Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.rolltables.JfQLnO61Sc9ZMYWb]{Indefinite Madness} trait. While addicted, it gains a level of exhaustion whenever it goes longer than 7 days without consuming a roach. Each time it fails this Wisdom save, it gains an additional Indefinite Madness trait and the time before exhaustion sets in decreases by 1 day, to a minimum of 1 day. Addiction can be ended by a <em>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl]{Remove Curse}</em> spell and its lingering madness traits can be cured by a <em>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.WzvJ7G3cqvIubsLk]{Greater Restoration}</em> spell or similar magic.</p>\n<h2>Vacuum</h2>\n<p>The vacuum of space is the apex of hazards; its extreme temperature and complete absence of air are universally lethal. No creature can hold its breath in a vacuum. Upon entering a vacuum without a breathing apparatus, a creature can survive a number of rounds equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum 2 rounds). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hits points and is dying.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; A creature with a breathing apparatus might still be subject to Extreme Temperature if it doesn't have other protective equipment.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; Casting a spell with a verbal component is impossible in a vacuum.</p>\n<h2>Variable Gravity</h2>\n<p>Though it&rsquo;s natural to take gravitational forces for granted while on a planet or within a ship with artificial gravity, the &lsquo;verse abounds with different gravitational environments, each of which pose a unique challenge to spacers and explorers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; <em>Zero Gravity</em>. Whenever a ship loses its life support system while in the Black or someone decides to go on a spacewalk, they experience zero gravity. In zero gravity environments, creatures and objects hang in the air until they are moved. A creature in zero gravity can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. Its speed is otherwise reduced to zero. Once a creature or object is set into motion, it can&rsquo;t stop moving until it collides with an obstacle. A creature automatically continues its movement at the same speed at the beginning of its turn, and an object set in motion moves with the same speed each round after it was moved.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; Creatures and objects in an area of zero gravity have no weight, but still may require some strength to push.</p>\n<p><em>&nbsp; Low Gravity</em>. Planetoids, asteroids, and moons with any sort of gravity will have low gravity, which only tenuously draws objects to the surface after allowing them to linger in the air for some time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; In low gravity, the weight of all creatures and objectsis halved. A creature in low gravity can jump twice the normal height and distance. Additionally, a creature takes half damage from falling in low gravity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; <em>High Gravity</em>. High gravity conditions are common in the &lsquo;verse, as it is the default environment for large and dense planets, though it also occurs whenever a ship strays too close to a massive object, such as a star or a black hole.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; Each creature in an area of high gravity area must spend two feet of movement for every foot moved, including flying, jumping, and climbing movement. This can be combined with difficult terrain to slow movement to a quarter of normal speed. If a prone creature wishes to stand up, it must succeed on a DC 12 Strength check. On a failure, it can&rsquo;t move at all on its turn.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; Objects in the area, including those being worn or carried, weigh double their usual weight, which therefore may cause creatures to become encumbered or cause loadbearing spells like levitate to fail. Creatures and objects take double damage from falling.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; <em>Extreme Gravity</em>. While high gravity can be tolerated for some time, extreme gravity is outright lethal. Extreme gravity carries all the penalties of high gravity, but a creature makes all Strength and Dexterity ability checks and saving throws with disadvantage. Additionally, at the beginning of its turn, a creature in extreme gravity takes bludgeoning damage based on its size: a Small creature takes 1d4 bludgeoning damage, a Medium creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage, a Large creature takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage, a Huge creature takes 1d10 bludgeoning damage, and a Gargantuan creature takes 1d12 bludgeoning damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","img":"icons/svg/radiation.svg"}
{"_id":"OeuEsHodizvnr7ty","name":"Race - Amoeboid","permission":{"default":0,"PmXouJxFyK2lSXOA":3},"folder":"","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.BIRToLagxv8zit7E"}},"content":"<h1>Amoeboids</h1>\n<p>Amorphous, bizarre, and remarkably advanced, amoeboids are the very definition of alien. Encountering them is practically dizzying for first-time visitors to a maw: their eerily transparent bodies flash with dim organic lights, shapeshifting into vague forms and imperfect copies of various creatures, all accompanied by a strange hum of blurbles and tones. Though the universe excels in producing creatures of diverse shapes and sizes, the amoeboids are something truly unique.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; Moreover, amoeboids are gifted with exceptional intelligence, and many possess a natural talent with machines. They were among the first space-bound races (the first, if one considers their origin), and remain pioneers in Dark Matter technology. Most amoeboids place tremendous faith in scientific reasoning, to the extent that a sound statistical model will often be more convincing than reported events. This, of course, extends to magical research, and amoeboid technology rests at the cuttingedge intersection of science and arcana.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; Such unique humanoids ought to come from an equally unique homeworld, but this is not the case; amoeboids were simply&nbsp; discovered on the maws. Some speculate that the amoeboids evolved there among the advanced technology, but just as many support the theory that amoeboids were designed and purposefully placed on the maws.</p>\n<h3>The Grand Mystery</h3>\n<p>The universe has no shortage of mysteries and enigmas, but scholars have long agreed that the origin of the maws, and how the amoeboids came to inhabit them, is the Grand Mystery. After all, nothing so fantastic could be a mere coincidence; the maws are a ready-made transit network, connecting the far reaches of the galaxy, complete with a resident race of shapeshifters intelligent enough to understand them and skilled enough to maintain them. Indeed, most races would likely have never discovered Dark Matter technology without observing the maw stations firsthand. Every technological discovery is built on the shoulders of giants, but in this case, the giants have gone mysteriously absent.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;More perplexing is that the maws are not merely technological in nature; they are constructed atop colossal skeletons of long-dead creatures. The bones themselves seem critically important, for it is impossible to create a stable maw portal without them, but what role they play is completely baffling to researchers. Moreover, it’s unclear what type of creature left the bones, for nothing alive today even remotely resembles them. Are these creatures extinct, or simply yet undiscovered? Do they originate from inside the galaxy, or even from within our universe?</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;For their part, the amoeboids have few answers to the Grand Mystery; their origins are as inscrutable to them as anyone else. The earliest amoeboid records date to the first instances of amoeboids learning how to interface with maw terminals and record data, perhaps a century after the supposed “zero” generation. Before that is a short but impenetrable dark age stretching back to the activation of the maws and obscuring their origin.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;It is in their nature to search for answers from a scientific frame of reference, but real evidence has been elusive so far. Speculation points to Old Un being involved in the Mystery, but what role he played is unclear. Perhaps the Grand Mystery has been intentionally obscured by a powerful creator or creators, or perhaps all involved are missing some critical piece, some insight that links the amoeboids, the maws, and their enigmatic creation.</p>\n<h3>Expanding the Compendium</h3>\n<p>Before most races mastered spaceflight and journeyed to the stars, the only records of amoeboids were of bug-eyed visitors from another world, arriving by night in strange saucers to abduct livestock and flash otherworldly lights. Amoeboids were among the first to travel the stars (their ships derived from technology found on the maws), and they did so with purely scientific intentions: every alien planet, star, nebula, and creature they discover is studied, categorized, and detailed in a vast database of arcane terminals called the Compendium. This single database, a collection of nearly everything known to them, is a scientific marvel, a monument to all amoeboid achievement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;To this day, amoeboids are the only race that maintains a non-involvement policy in their visits to other worlds, keeping their distance, observing remotely when possible, and experimenting only when disturbance can be minimized. The sole exception to non-involvement is with spacefaring races that have journeyed to the maws themselves; the amoeboids greet such groups as equals, and welcome them with access to the galactic community.</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Amoeboid\" data-language=\"amoeboid\"><em>“Another failed experiment,” muttered Yr.</em></span><br><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Amoeboid\" data-language=\"amoeboid\">The amoeboid’s nucleus flashed dark red, his version of a resigned sigh. Standing in the medical bay of his saucer, he watched a pair of automatons clean viscera off the walls and ceiling.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Amoeboid\" data-language=\"amoeboid\">&nbsp; &nbsp;“The serum made no difference; those cows were just like the last batch,” said Yr, making a gesture like stroking his chin. He made his way to the next room, where a terrified human man lay restrained on a table, yelling incoherently. He touched the man and his shape changed, taking on more human-like proportions, but with a grossly overlarge head and bulging eyes.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Amoeboid\" data-language=\"amoeboid\">&nbsp; &nbsp;“Sorry for the inconvenience,” Yr apologized in the man’s language. “I wish I could repay you for your livestock, but we have rules against that sort of thing, I’m afraid. Now please stop squirming while I ready a memory modification.”</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>— Yr, amoeboid scientist, assessing a Void experiment</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Amoeboids are intelligent, vaguely humanoid-shaped, translucent oozes that can mimic the form of any creature they touch. These creatures tend to the maw stations, experimenting into the nature of space and time, parlaying with any creature they meet.</p>\n<h2>Fluid Anatomy</h2>\n<p>Amoeboid bodies are almost entirely composed of a translucent jelly-like substance, with a complex network of nerves visible throughout, which emit a dim blue light. Within their heads, a large, brain-like nucleus floats, surrounded by five eyespots spaced radially around it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Their fluid bodies can take the genetic imprint of creatures they touch, molding into an inexact copy, visibly made of the same jelly material. When in this form, however, amoeboids can speak the language of their copy and move in much the same way, allowing them to empathize with virtually any creature.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;No one is sure exactly how the bizarre anatomy of the amoeboids came to be, for they are among the oldest races in the 'verse and few accounts exist before them. The elves believe that their strange forms were created on a rogue world, flung into the Black by a catastrophic event, but the avia-ra maintain that their forms are a result of long-term corruption by the Void. There might be some credence to this latter theory, for those that are exposed to the Void's terrible lights and survive undergo the warp and are changed in drastic and horrifying ways, being robbed forever of their previous forms. Perhaps, it is possible that the amoeboids were warped so intensely they were left as mere genetic sludge, lacking any true shape.</p>\n<h2>Scientists and Mawkeepers</h2>\n<p>Above all else, amoeboids value logical thinking as a lens to analyze the world. They keenly believe that the multiverse is founded on an objective, concrete reality defined solely by magic and physics, all of which can be understood. All things, including the elusive mystery of the maw stations, can be unraveled with proper attention, experimentation, and reasoning. Most amoeboids regard no subject as taboo and have few qualms about any kind of research, as long as its methodology is sound and is reasonably likely to produce useful data.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Most amoeboids live on the maw stations themselves, researching the maw's activities, repairing ships and Dark Matter engines, and trading information with other scientists and wizards the 'verse over. With their keen intellect, amoeboids make excellent alchemists, gadgeteers, and wizards, and can find no better place to live than the maw stations.</p>\n<h2>Strange Visitors</h2>\n<p>Amoeboids have taken to visiting settled worlds in secret, disguising their saucers and themselves to perform experiments on the inhabitants. By and large, these experiments are noninvasive, but are nonetheless unwelcome. As a result, many worlds have ancient tales of strange visitors from the stars, looking much like them, but strangely distorted, who steal individuals away by night and subject them to strange rituals in brightly lit rooms. Amoeboids will also vivisect the odd head of livestock, but these occurrences are more likely to be blamed on predators than on men from the stars.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/races/amoeboid.png"}

Suddenly, a spark of blue electricity flashes across the room and scorches the far wall. The gnome grins and puts away his tools.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;An amoeboid carefully positions a rabbit on a pedestal, stands back, and presses a large red button. With a pop and a puff of fur, the rabbit vanishes, only to hop back into the room seconds later, hairless from the waist down. The amoeboid nods and scratches down a few notes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;A bald human woman with a glowing, red, robotic eye tightens the joints on her new cybernetic arm. Her work complete, she rears back her metal fist and crushes a nearby chair.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Gadgeteers are masters of technology and engineering, turning every device available to their advantage. Assisted by their artificial intelligence companions, gadgeteers pursue the cutting edge of science and innovation, acquiring a mass of gadgets and a wealth of knowledge along the way.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Cutting-Edge Innovators</h2>\n<div><img style=\"float: left;\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/classes/gadgeteer-full-alp.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"256\" height=\"211\" /></div>\n<p>Impelled by the lure of systems and logic, a wildly eccentric group embraces the sciences. These disparate tinkers, students, and inventors tend to be uniformly welleducated (or at least highly self-educated) in the principles of science, arcana, and engineering, with a particular focus on practical applications. Though most gadgeteers are at least curious about the underlying mysteries of the universe, many view groundbreaking scientific discoveries as a means to an end; theory only exists to facilitate application.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Fueled by breakthroughs and scientific advances, gadgeteers push the cutting edge of science and innovation, devising new technological marvels (or at least new blaster variants) at a breakneck pace. Some gadgeteers become absorbed in a particular problem, innovating and optimizing solutions for it alone, while others devise technological marvels wherever they can find application. All the great advances of the modern world, from datapads to Dark Matter engines, have been spearheaded by gadgeteers.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>AIs</h2>\n<p>A gadgeteer is rarely seen far from the floating holographic orb that is their Artificial Intelligence (AI) companion. After all, an organic brain can only hold so much information, whereas an AI can recall equations, trace schematics, and perform calculations with ease. Such intellect is nothing without a gadgeteer's ingenuity, of course, but the watchful eye of an AI can still spot errors that their creator might not have noticed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;But more than that, an AI companion is also a tireless friend. The endless work of a gadgeteer can often be monotonous and isolating, but the constant, friendly voice of an AI in one's ear goes a long way to preventing mad scientists and doomsday devices.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Creating a Gadgeteer</h2>\n<p>When devising your gadgeteer, consider what draws your character to the sciences. Is it the challenge of working out a new puzzle, or the thrill of perfecting a new invention? Perhaps your character is obsessed with a particular facet of the universe, and longs to unravel its mysteries. Think about how you learned about science and engineering. Did you have a mentor that shaped your understanding, or are you totally self-educated?</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, consider which Prototype you&rsquo;ll pick when you reach 2nd level. Are you interested in having a gadget for every situation, or do you just prefer having a big, hulking mech suit? Consider what this prototype means for your specialization and your character&rsquo;s personality in general. Lastly, put some thought into your AI. What&rsquo;s its name, and what type of personality does it possess, if any?</p>\n<h3>Quick Build</h3>\n<p>Follow these suggestions to quickly build a gadgeteer. Choose Intelligence as your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. Investing in Constitution might also be wise for characters that intend to select the Experimental Frame Prototype at 2nd level. For your equipment, choose a researcher&rsquo;s pack and an antimatter dagger. Lastly, choose the Technologist background.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>Class Features</h1>\n<p>As a gadgeteer, you gain the following class features:</p>\n<h3>Hit Points</h3>\n<p><strong>Hit Dice</strong>: 1d6 per gadgeteer level</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level</strong>: 6 + your Constitution modifier</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels</strong>: 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per gadgeteer level after 1st</p>\n<h3>Proficiencies</h3>\n<p><strong>Armor</strong>: Light armor</p>\n<p><strong>Weapons</strong>: Simple and martial blasters, simple weapons</p>\n<p><strong>Tools</strong>: Alchemist&rsquo;s supplies, circuitry kit, mechanist&rsquo;s tools, ship maintenance tools, smith&rsquo;s tools, tinker tools</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throws</strong>: Intelligence, Dexterity</p>\n<p><strong>Skills</strong>: Choose three from Arcana, Data, Deception, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Piloting, Religion, Sleight of Hand, or Technology</p>\n<h3>Equipment</h3>\n<p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A repeater and any simple weapon</li>\n<li>(a) a martial blaster or (b) two simple blasters</li>\n<li>(a) a circuitry kit or (b) a mechanist&rsquo;s tools</li>\n<li>An engineer&rsquo;s pack and leather armor</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>AI Companion</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 1st level, you are assisted by an AI companion, an intricate data construct which lives on your datapad and possesses near human-like levels of intelligence.

Your companion can solve any arithmetic or strictly logical problem you pose to it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Additionally, whenever you make an Intelligence (Technology) check, you can treat the result as 10, or your gadgeteer level + your Intelligence modifier, whichever is higher.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Your AI companion downloads and integrates knowledge of additional subjects as you gain higher levels in this class. At 6th level, and again at 10th level and 15th level, you can choose one of the following skills to gain this benefit when you make an Intelligence check with it: Arcana, Data, History, Investigation, Nature, or Religion.</p>\n<h2>Gadgets</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you begin to amass a collection of cutting-edge technological devices called gadgets. You gain one gadget of your choice for which you meet the prerequisites. Because your gadgets are powered by your personal power cell, no other creature can use them. If one of your gadgets is lost or damaged, you can fashion a new one for no cost when you take a long rest.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;You acquire additional gadgets as you gain levels in this class, as shown on the Gadgeteer table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the gadgets you have and replace it with another one that you could gain at that level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Your gadget options are detailed at the end of the class description.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Saving Throws</em>. If one of your gadgets calls for a saving throw, its DC is calculated as follows:</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Gadget save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<h2>Overcharge</h2>\n<p>With your technical aptitude and ingenuity, you can modify blasters to fire in more intense bursts. Starting at 2nd level, once on each of your turns when you hit a target with an attack from a blaster, you can deal an additional die of damage to that target.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;This ability improves as you gain levels in this class. You add an additional die of damage at 5th level (2 dice), 11th level (3 dice), and 17th level (4 dice). Additionally, starting at 11th level, when you use this ability, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the blaster&rsquo;s damage roll.</p>\n<h2>Prototype</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, you make a breakthrough innovation with a prototype of your own design. Choose one of the following three prototypes.</p>\n<h3>Experimental Frame</h3>\n<p>You have developed a sophisticated experimental frame, a powerful exo-suit that augments your strength and shelters you from harm. Your experimental frame counts as heavy armor, which you can don or doff as a bonus action, and it also grants you the benefits of a life suit. You are proficient with your experimental frame, but no other creature can wear it. While wearing your frame, you gain the following benefits:</p>\n<p>&bull; Your size becomes Medium, if it is smaller.</p>\n<p>&bull; Your movement speed increases to 30 feet, if it is less.</p>\n<p>&bull; Your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Intelligence modifier. This armor can't be enchanted or modified to improve its Armor Class.</p>\n<p>&bull; Whenever you begin your turn wearing this frame, you gain temporary hit points equal to your gadgeteer level. These hit points last until you remove the frame.</p>\n<p>&bull; You can integrate a simple or martial weapon directly into your frame, or you can integrate two weapons (one into each arm) if neither has the Two-Handed property. When you draw an integrated weapon, it snaps to your hand and you can&rsquo;t be disarmed of it. Your frame is programmed in all manner of combat protocol, so you can use these integrated weapons proficiently while wearing your frame, even if you're not normally proficient in their use. You can switch which weapons are integrated when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>&bull; When you make an attack with an integrated melee weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of your Strength or Dexterity, for attack and damage rolls.</p>\n<p>&bull; Starting at 5th level, when you make a melee weapon attack with an integrated weapon, you can make an additional melee attack using that weapon as a bonus action.</p>\n<h3>@Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.monsters.gcv0riOmF3lR0gvw]{Mechanized Autonomous Construct}</h3>\n<p>You have put the finishing touches on a Mechanized Autonomous Construct (a MAC), which is a speciallyconstructed automaton piloted by your AI.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The construct has statistics as shown above, and takes its own turn in combat immediately after yours. On your turn, you can mentally command your construct if it is within 500 feet of you (no action required). You decide what action it will take and where it will move during its turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. In combat, your construct's actions are governed by its Combat Protocols, which you can switch as a bonus action on your turn. If you are incapacitated or absent, your AI guides your construct to protect you and itself.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; If your construct drops to 0 hit points, it becomes disabled. When you take a long rest, you can repair your construct to its full hit points. You are always considered to have enough materials to build and repair your construct.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; You can integrate weapons and gadgets directly into your construct. You can integrate one two-handed melee weapon, two one-handed melee weapons, or a one-handed melee weapon and a gadget. When your construct draws an integrated weapon or gadget, the item snaps to its hand and it can&rsquo;t be disarmed of it. Your construct is proficient with any weapons integrated into it. The construct takes the Use an Object action to activate an integrated gadget.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Starting at 5th level, your construct makes two attacks, instead of one, when you command it to take the Attack action with its integrated weapons.</p>\n<h3>Utility Matrix</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; You have developed a utility matrix, an advanced, cubeshaped mechanism that rearranges its form and function into that of other devices. Your matrix can become any of the following gadgets, which you can use at will:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Cloaking Device</strong></em>. As an action, you can activate your cloaking device to temporarily warp the light around you and hide yourself from view. You become invisible until the beginning of your next turn, or until you make an attack, cast a spell, or use a gadget. Once you use this gadget, you can't use it again on the following round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Flashbang</strong></em>. As a bonus action, you throw a concussive bomb at your feet, disorienting and distracting nearby foes. Each creature within 5 feet of you can't take reactions until the start of its next turn. Once you use this gadget, you can't use it again on the following round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Forcefield Projector</strong></em>. As a bonus action, you can activate your forcefield projector, temporarily sheltering yourself behind a powerful electromagnetic field. Until the beginning of your next turn, your Armor Class increases by your Intelligence modifier. Once you use this gadget, you can't use it again on the following round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Grappling Hook</strong></em>. As a reaction when you fall, or as a bonus action on your turn, you can project a grappling hook at a target location you can see within your movement speed. If the target location can hold your weight, you are pulled there, expending movement normally. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. Once you use this gadget, you can't use it again on the following round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Modular Gadget</strong></em>. Starting at 5th level, you can reconfigure your utility matrix into an un-upgraded gadget of your choice that does not have prerequisites. This gadget doesn't count against your total number of gadgets known. Alternately, you can reconfigure your utility matrix into an upgrade for an existing gadget for which you meet prerequisites. Once you reconfigure your utility matrix, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2>Tech Specialty</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 3rd level, you adopt a tech specialty that informs your gadgeteering expertise. Choose one Tech Specialty option. Your selection grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>\n<h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can&rsquo;t increase an ability score<br />above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<h2>Bluescreen Protocol</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 7th level, you have integrated a complex construct-disabling algorithm into your AI companion, which you can activate as an action. Each construct within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw with disadvantage against your Gadget save DC. On a failed save, a construct is incapacitated and its speed is reduced<br />to 0 until the beginning of your next turn, even if it would otherwise be immune to being incapacitated.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h2>Override Protocol</h2>\n<p>At 18th level, your AI companion can upload a devastating virus to seize control of a construct. You can use your action to touch a construct within your reach, which must succeed a Wisdom saving throw against your Gadget save DC or be charmed by you for 1 hour, even if it would otherwise be immune to being charmed. While it is charmed, you can issue commands to the construct while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as attack that creature, run over there, or fetch that object. If the construct completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2>Antimagic Pulse</h2>\n<p>By 20th level, you perfect a cutting-edge device capable of producing an antimagic pulse (abbreviated AMP), a type of energetic burst that completely disrupts and disables magic and machines. You can use your action to throw this device to a location within 60 feet, which explodes in a flash of blue light. This device creates an antimagic field (as per the spell) for 1 minute centered on the device, with the following changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The effect is a 20-foot radius sphere.</li>\n<li>Magical technology (including your gadgets and blasters) count as magic items and are suppressed within the sphere. Blasters can&rsquo;t be used to make attacks while within the sphere, and attacks with them can&rsquo;t penetrate into it.</li>\n<li>Constructs within the sphere are paralyzed for the duration, even if they would otherwise be immune to this condition.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Destroying the device once it is thrown doesn't end its effects early. Once you use this device, it fizzles out. You can make a new one when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h1>Tech Specialties</h1>\n<p>Gadgeteers tend to be well-read on a variety of subjects, from data structures and artificial intelligence to blaster mechanics and engineering, but typically put their finest efforts into a pet project of some sort. While working on other tasks, the details of their pet project are running in the background of their minds, slowly being solved and pieced together, while other work busies their hands.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With enough experience, the subjects of a gadgeteer&rsquo;s hobby become their tech specialty, a topic in which they are as expert as they are captivated. Often, this specialty is coupled with an objective, a goal to be engineered. Gadgeteers will travel great distances to share research on their mutual specialties, exchanging breakthroughs and discoveries in an effort to achieve a common goal.</p>\n<h2>Drone Jockey</h2>\n<p>Most gadgeteers tinker with drones at some point in their career; after all, they&rsquo;re compact, useful projects, with a limited number of moving parts. However, only drone jockeys take this to the extreme of arming themselves with a small army of programmed drones. By linking the drones&rsquo; sensors and construct cores, they create a more cunning swarm intelligence, distributed over the drone network as a whole. This swarm can act almost autonomously, scouting the area and defending the jockey with mechanical efficiency.</p>\n<h3>Hivemaster</h3>\n<p>Starting when you choose this specialty, you gain a special drone controller magic item and a pair of drones. These drones can be any two of the following three: a defense drone, a medical drone, or a recon drone (see Monsters chapter for statistics). Your drone controller is linked to both drones and you can use your bonus action to command all of your drones at once.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your drones are improved in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can add your level to the HP of your drones.</li>\n<li>When one of your drones makes an attack, its attack bonus equals your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.</li>\n<li>When your medical drone heals a creature, it restores 1d10 hit points.</li>\n<li>Your recon drone marks three creatures it can see, instead of only one.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You gain an additional drone of your choice at 6th level (3 drones), 10th level (4 drones), and 14th level (5 drones).</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your <em>drone controller</em> can only command three drones at a time, and only two of those drones can be the same type, but you can deploy a stored drone as an action if one becomes disabled. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can retrofit one of your drones, changing it into a different type.</p>\n<h3>Sacrificial Dive</h3>\n<p>At 6th level, when you are targeted by a ranged attack, you can use your reaction to command one of your drones within 5 feet of you to fly in the way of the attack. This attack targets the drone instead.</p>\n<h3>Focus Fire</h3>\n<p>Beginning at 10th level, your AI companion takes direct control of your drones, aiming and firing them as you direct. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can command your drones without using a bonus action.</p>\n<h3>Omega Drone</h3>\n<p>At 14th level, as an action, you can combine three of your drones (a defense drone, a medical drone, and a recon drone) into a single omega drone. Once combined, the omega drone&rsquo;s AC equals 10 + your Intelligence modifier, its HP equals 5 times your level, and its ability scores are all 14.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The drone can take all the actions of its constituent drones and takes its own turn immediately after yours in initiative, acting as directed by your AI. On a hit with its integrated blaster, it deals 3d6 radiant damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your <em>drone controller</em> can't link to other drones while your omega drone is active. You can separate your omega drone back into its constituent drones as an action.</p>\n<h2>Futurist</h2>\n<p>As a futurist, you believe that artificial intelligence is the zenith of all invention. To engineer a perfect AI, one which is capable of inventing on its own merits, is to conquer limitless problems by proxy. After all, an advanced AI which doesn't degrade into a rogue intelligence could turn its vastly superior intellect to dramatically improving the world, innovating in ways organic minds couldn't imagine. Your experiments with neural networks and intelligence theory have steadily edged you closer to finding such an AI, and granted your AI companion newfound aptitude along the way.</p>\n<h3>Advanced Subroutines</h3>\n<p>Starting when you choose this specialty at 3rd level, your AI takes a more active role in assisting you, rather than merely chirping up from time to time. Your AI can run any of the following subroutines, and you can command it to switch between subroutines as a bonus action.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Genetic Algorithm</em>. When you take damage from a hostile creature, subtract 1 from the damage dealt. Each additional time you take damage while this subroutine is running, the amount you subtract from the damage dealt increases by 1, up to a maximum of your Intelligence modifier. This amount resets to 1 after 1 minute or when you switch subroutines.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Heatmap</em>. When you have advantage on a weapon attack, you can add your proficiency bonus to the damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Neural Network</em>. When you use the Attack action to attack a hostile creature and miss, you gain a cumulative +1 bonus to subsequent attack rolls you make while this subroutine is running, up to a maximum of your Intelligence modifier. You don't increase this bonus if you attempt to attack a creature that you can't see or a creature that can't be hit. This amount resets to 0 after 1 minute or when you switch subroutines.</p>\n<h3>Novel Intelligence</h3>\n<p>At 3rd level, you have vastly improved your AI's intellect. Your AI Companion feature applies its benefit to another Intelligence skill of your choice. Additionally, your AI knows all languages and can perfectly recall everything it has seen and heard within the last 30 days.</p>\n<h3>Tactical Analysis</h3>\n<p>Starting at 6th level, as a bonus action, you can command your AI to perform a full evaluation of your strategic options and advise you of likely scenarios. Until the beginning of your next turn, you have advantage on the next attack roll you make, and the next attack roll made against you has disadvantage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Recursive Deterrence</h3>\n<p>By 10th level, your AI has implemented passive routines that scan for incoming blaster fire and ready you for counterattack. As a reaction when a creature within 15 feet of you makes a ranged weapon attack, you can use your reaction to make a ranged weapon attack targeting that creature.</p>\n<h3>Singularity</h3>\n<p>Beginning at 14th level, your AI is nearly prescient. As a bonus action, you can allow your AI to override your very movements, guiding your shots to where targets will be. For the next minute, whenever you make a ranged attack roll and don't have disadvantage, you can treat the result as being equal to your gadgeteer level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Hardlight Architect</h3>\n<p>Hardlight might well be the penultimate arcane discovery. It is a strong yet malleable material, conjured fully-shaped from energy alone, and it can be used to construct entire functional systems in a flash. Through hardlight, engineers and arcanists can spontaneously prototype new designs in real space and replicate these designs later. Hardlight architects recognize the monumental importance of this material and dedicate their ambition and creativity to mastering it. As you perfect all the established hardlight spells, you constantly dream up new, innovative uses for the material, awaiting the day you can conjure a towering suit of hardlight power armor to crush your enemies and intimidate your rivals.</p>\n<h3>Hardlight Projector</h3>\n<p>When you choose this specialty at 3rd level, you construct a hardlight projector, a device capable of forming hardlight and shaping it to your whims. If the projector is lost or destroyed, you can construct a new one over a long rest for 200 gp. By using this device as an action, you can create a simple geometrical object of shimmering hardlight which must fit within a 1-foot cube. Whatever its shape, the object weighs 1 pound, lasts for 1 minute, has AC 10, and has 5 hit points.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Additionally, you can use the projector to cast the @Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.spells.CsNvRRgV7yDrKnZ6]{hardlight needle} cantrip.</p>\n<h3>Hardlight Spellcasting</h3>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, you can use your hardlight projector to emulate the actions of a spellcaster, enabling you to create more substantial hardlight spells. Your spell save DC for these spells equals your Gadget save DC and your spell attack bonus equals your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You can cast the spells hardlight blaster and hardlight nails once each and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Additionally, at 6th level, you can cast the spells hardlight construction and hardlight gauntlet once each. At 14th level, you can cast the spell hardlight frame once. You regain the ability to cast each of these spells when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Lightforge</h3>\n<p>Starting at 6th level, as a bonus action, you can forge a shield, a set of artisan tools, or any melee weapon that deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, entirely out of scintillating hardlight. After 10 minutes, this object evaporates completely into light.</p>\n<h3>Prototype Luxcannon</h3>\n<p>By 10th level, you&rsquo;ve perfected a stable hardlight weapon, which you can conjure effortlessly. You can cast the spell hardlight blaster at will and can apply your Overcharge feature to the spell.</p>\n<h3>Transient Avatar</h3>\n<p>At 14th level, you can cast the spell conjure hardlight avatar without using a spell slot or spell components as a bonus action. The spell's duration is until the end of your next turn. Once you cast this spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2>Mastermaker</h2>\n<p><img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"worlds/dm-start/images/items/classes/avia-ra-gadgeteer.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"198\" />Nearly all gadgeteers strive for perfection in their work, but mastermakers take this to a logical extreme: using the technology at their disposal, they seek to engineer away their own biological defects. By grafting gadgets and technology onto their bodies (and making liberal use of vect components), mastermakers gradually become hybrids of humanoids and machines. They are stronger, tougher, and more agile than their counterparts, but many would argue that their techniques are too extreme&mdash;too unnatural&mdash;no matter what the results.</p>\n<h3>Thermalsight</h3>\n<p>Starting when you choose this specialty at 3rd level, you have installed a vect optical sensor in place of one of your eyes, granting you thermalsight. You can see living creatures through darkness and heavily obscured conditions, such as fog, out to a range of 30 feet. You can also determine if a creature is living or dead though its body heat. However, you can't discern color, nor use this sense to see through illusions, invisibility, or magical darkness. This sense is blocked by one inch of any solid barrier. If you already had thermalsight, its range increases by 30 feet.</p>\n<h3>Embedded Gadgets</h3>\n<p>At 3rd level, you can install one gadget or a one-handed blaster directly into one of your arms. You can&rsquo;t be disarmed of this item and you can use it if at least one of your hands is free. Additionally, you can perfectly conceal this item, so long as another creature does not inspect the metal plates installed in your arm. You can change which gadget or blaster you have embedded when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Additionally, you don&rsquo;t lose hit points or hit dice from installing or removing construct grafts, and it takes you no time to recover after the attachment of a new graft.</p>\n<h3>Carbon Fiber Skin</h3>\n<p>At 6th level, you have installed a durable metallic mesh under much of your skin, and metallic plates to protect your organs. Your Armor Class increases by 1.</p>\n<h3>Reconfigure</h3>\n<p>By 10th level, enough of your body is mechanical that you can reconfigure your parts to improve your agility, might, or even intellect. One ability score of your choice increases by 2 and you can change this selection whenever you finish a long rest. You can't increase Constitution using this trait and you can't increase any ability score above 20.</p>\n<h3>Construct Perfection</h3>\n<p>By 14th level, you have achieved the height of construct superiority by installing a construct core directly into your head. You no longer need to sleep and magic can&rsquo;t put you to sleep. You are immune to being charmed, frightened, or possessed. Additionally, the maximum for your Intelligence score is now 22.</p>\n<h2>Nanoengineer</h2>\n<p>While other gadgeteers tinker with machines that fit in the palm of your hand, your machinations are smaller and your ambitions grander. As a nanoengineer, you work with nanomachines, unfathomably tiny robots capable of massive feats, from stitching together wounds at the microscopic level, to forming extraordinarily resilient materials. Your machines might appear as nothing more than a small blob of gray ooze, but once set to work, their effects are unmistakable.</p>\n<h3>Cutting-Edge Nanobots</h3>\n<p>Beginning when you choose this specialty at 3rd level, you have assembled a fabricator which generates a steady stream of advanced nanobots, called nanites. Your supply of nanites is represented by a pool of Nano points equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your gadgeteer level, rounded down. You can expend Nano points to employ your nanobots in varying ways, described below, and you regain all expended Nano points when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Deconstruct</em>. As an action, you well up a mass of nanites in your hand and fling them at a target within 15 feet of you. Spend any number of Nano points and make a ranged attack roll if the target is out of your reach; you automatically hit if the target is within your reach. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 necrotic damage per Nano point expended as the nanites unravel it at a cellular level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Nano-Hack</em>. You can expend up to 3 Nano points when you make an Intelligence (Data) check to hack a piece of technology, inserting your nanites into the machine. You can add 1d4 to the roll for each Nano point expended.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Reconstruct</em>. As an action, you can expend any number of Nano points to create a thin stream of nanites to repair damage and mend wounds of a willing target within 15 feet of you. The target regains 1d6 hit points per Nano point expended.</p>\n<h3>Nano-Duplicate</h3>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, as a bonus action, you can use your nanites to duplicate the exact shape, but not color or texture, of an object you touch that can fit within a 1-foot cube. The replica is made of nanites and lasts for 10 minutes.</p>\n<h3>Recycling Protocol</h3>\n<p>Starting at 6th level, you've programmed your nanites to repurpose material and multiply. When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points using a melee weapon attack or your Deconstruct ability, you regain 2 expended Nano points.</p>\n<h3>Nanite Weave</h3>\n<p>Starting at 10th level, you can use your action and spend up to 3 Nano points to stitch your nanites together in a protective mesh above your skin. These Nano points are invested in the mesh; you can have up to 3 points invested at once. While you aren't wielding a shield, you gain a bonus to your Armor Class equal to the number of Nano points invested. Whenever you take damage, nanites in the mesh are destroyed and you lose 1 invested point.</p>\n<h3>Network Response</h3>\n<p>Starting at 14th level, you can use your reaction when you take damage to use your Deconstruct ability, targeting the attacker, or Reconstruct ability, targeting yourself, spending up to 3 Nano points on either ability.</p>\n<h1>Gadgets</h1>\n<p><img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"worlds/dm-start/images/items/classes/death-ray-a.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"212\" /></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Your 'death ray' is just a blaster which kills people? I have an axe that kills people. Does that make it a 'death axe'?\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;- Throg, half-orc barbarian who asks really good questions</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If a gadget or an upgrade has prerequisites, you must meet them to gain it. You can gain a gadget or upgrade at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your gadgets count as magical technology. You must have a gadget before you can select its upgrade. If a gadget calls for a spell or magic item which requires a saving throw, its uses your Gadget save DC.</p>\n<h3>Adaptable Omnitool</h3>\n<p>This gadget can be configured into a number of useful devices, including the following:</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Auto-Entry Device</em>. This device automatically attempts to crack physical locks or hack powered doors when set to do so as an action. Its ability check for doing so is 10 + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Rebreather</em>. You can start or stop breathing through this apparatus as a bonus action. When doing so, you can breathe normally in airless environments. This device also shelters you from toxic fumes and other airborne poisons. You can't talk while breathing through this device.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Scanner</em>. As an action, you can use your handheld scanner to analyze the electromagnetic spectrum around you. Your scanner detects the presence, number, and type of technological devices within 30 feet of you and can determine whether or not a unique construct or device has been present in the area within the last hour.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Taser</em>. This device produces a debilitating current of electricity when you use it as an action. Make a melee attack roll (attack bonus equals your Intelligence bonus + your proficiency modifier) against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 lightning damage, and it can't take reactions until the start of its next turn. This damage increases to 2d8 lightning damage at when you reach 5th level, 3d8 at 11th level, and 4d8 at 17th level.</p>\n<h3>Blink Button</h3>\n<p>This complicated looking device has a single large red button on its face. When you press it as an action, you teleport up to 15 feet to an unoccupied location of your choice that you can see.</p>\n<h3>Bubble Projector</h3>\n<p>You construct a device that, as an action, creates a dome of force as if you had cast the spell geodesic shield.

According to these sources, the Tower is always in the shadows, pulling strings and attempting the hide the truth from the people. The truth is that people know very little about the Tower, save for its secrecy and its fraternal nature.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Tower is, indeed, a secret society of arcanists rife with cryptic ciphers and esoteric rites. It traces its origins back to Terminus the First, the same mage (now lich) who established the Hegemony of Man and expanded its boundaries. Terminus ostensibly founded the Tower as a fraternal order to unite arcanists from across the stars, but its clandestine nature makes its true intentions hard to discern. The Tower&rsquo;s inner-sanctums are closed to those who do not undergo their esoteric induction rituals, its agents speak in coded language, and the highest echelons of its memberships share profound secrets unknown to all others, including lower-ranking Tower agents.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Tower largely concerns itself with collecting and sequestering secrets, forbidden lore, and powerful artifacts. Whenever a new arcane relic comes to light, agents of the Tower are never far behind, investigating any strange occurrences and disappearing, relic in stow, as swiftly as they arrived. Their response times are infamous, for agents arrive at incidents almost as if they were given advance warning; it&rsquo;s hard to say which is more paranoid, that the Tower might have to do with the dissemination of dangerous magic relics, or that they have a secret web of eyes and ears, monitoring everything, always searching for them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Perhaps the Tower is truly a conspiratorial network of powerful arcanists with a grand agenda, or perhaps, for all its trappings, it&rsquo;s more like an arcane boy&rsquo;s club, trading secrets and restricting membership to the select few. It&rsquo;s even possible that the Tower sees itself as acting in the galaxy&rsquo;s interest by securing powerful artifacts and spells before they can fall into the wrong hands. What is certainly true is that the Tower&rsquo;s agents are as numerous as they are undetectable, that its libraries contain forbidden arcane knowledge, and that only a few know its true intentions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/the-tower.png","_id":"TJqGEiHa7k5nX5Rj"}

Concerned chiefly with accurately charting every system in the galaxy, A.I. has brokered centurieslong contracts with all of the major players in the Black, granting them a near-monopoly over galactic cartography. Additionally, A.I. offers swift, discreet travel services between over three thousand different ports of call, including every maw on the grid. If you need to get somewhere or find something, no one in the 'verse is going to do it faster than Astrogations Inc.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The greatest problem A.I. faces is that, unlike terrestrial cartography, the &ldquo;topology&rdquo; of the &lsquo;verse is in constant flux. While some points (such as the maw stations) rotate about the galactic core in relatively fixed positions, there are enough spatial anomalies, rogue planets, and gravitational channels to keep a dedicated mapmaker busy for several lifetimes; this doesn&rsquo;t even consider the trouble of keeping the galactic governmental demarcations accurate and true. Even small changes in gravitational pull on a trade route could send a freighter plunging into a star, so extremely accurate charts are imperative.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;To this end, A.I. deals in information of all kinds, purchasing star charts, planet scans, void jump data, and scans of anomalous events from explorers and spacers alike. This very information is cataloged and sold back to spacers to help refine navigation, dealt to the major galactic powers to define their borders, and used by spellcasters to accurately cast the astrogation spell, the company&rsquo;s namesake. Perfectly neutral in its dealings, A.I. will buy or sell from any willing customer, as long as doing so will turn a profit. The A.I. headquarters, located on Concordia, is said to possess hundreds of thousands of arcane terminals to store and collate its data.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Of course, A.I. has one additional trick up its sleeve to stay ahead of the competition: along with employing thousands of star-cartographers and information brokers, A.I. is also rumored to employ a staff of psychics, soothsayers, and oracles who attempt to divine the future of galactic movements. Long ago, A.I cartographers realized that, while the predictions of one psychic might be unreliable, the average of a hundred or more can yield consistently true results, even out to years in the future. It is even possible that A.I.&rsquo;s psychic think-tank has predicted more than just the future of galactic movements; that their psychics have divined great cataclysms that await the &lsquo;verse. Of course, if that were true, A.I. has remained silent on the matter, perhaps wishing to turn this information to profit in the future.</p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/astrogations-alp.png","_id":"VGT9UOzl9A4KHCvx"}
{"name":"Race - Gnomes","permission":{"default":0,"PmXouJxFyK2lSXOA":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.r4AN3h6iFSHasSbC"}},"content":"<p>Unique amongst the galactic races, the star gnomes give the galaxy a glimpse of what can be achieved without the crutch of magic. While fundamentally the same as terrestrial gnomes, star gnomes evolved on a world deep within a Dead Magic Zone; as such, they propelled themselves to both space and to galactic significance using technology alone, a testament to gnomish intellect and their boundless curiosity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Indeed, most star gnomes today tend to be skeptical of magic and standoffish with magical races, or at worst, hostile towards its practitioners. Few gnomes have come to accept magic as a part of daily life, even with generations of experience, and most prefer to continue enhancing and refining their technology.</p>\n<h2>A World Without Magic</h2>\n<p>While by no means a new race, the gnomes of Nebellion are one of the younger starfaring races. As their world is isolated within a Dead Magic Zone, the gnomes came to rely on their own ingenuity, instead of magical tricks, to cultivate their world. With time, gnomes developed an adept discipline founded on logical reasoning and manipulating nonmagical forces, which they call science. This science is the foundation of all gnomish technology, which is wholly independent from magic and can function without hindrance in Dead Magic Zones.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Naturally drawn to the underground, the gnomes transformed the caves and mountains of Nebellion into grand, glittering cities, packed with mechanical marvels of every variety. Eventually, the great spires of the undercities burst forth from the ground, and continued to grow like blades of grass wrought from steel and glass; now, there is little of Nebellion’s surface that isn’t covered by cityscape. While Nebellion’s environment hasn't suffered with the gnome’s expansion (freedom from reliance on burnable fuels being an early accomplishment of gnome tinkers), living space has become a premium. It was a search for this resource that led to their expansion into the stars.</p>\n<h2>The Silver Disc</h2>\n<p>Remarkably, nearly two decades before the gnomes first launched into space, they discovered that they had not been the first intelligent life on their homeworld. Embedded deep below the surface of Nebellion, gnomish explorers discovered what appeared to be a city-sized disc made of unknown metals, filled not with scientific marvels, but nonfunctional arcane devices. They also discovered the burnt-out remnants of a Dark Matter engine, and from there proceeded to reverse-engineer their way into the stars. Despite the fact that most of the enchanted objects (including those which seem to be recordings or record keepers) located on the vessel were intact, years of testing yielded no results; no form of gnomish power could cause them to spring to life, and even re-introduction to magic outside the Dead Magic Zone proved fruitless. To this day, it remains a mystery as to who landed on Nebellion, how long ago they landed, and how they traversed the Zone with such a vessel.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;What isn't a mystery is the effect the disc’s discovery had on gnomish society. Within fifteen years, the Traversal Guild had managed to create a functioning, low-class Dark Matter engine powered by fuel sources known to them. Five years later, they perfected the new technology and achieved spaceflight. Within fifty years, the gnomes had breached the edges of the Zone, reached the maw nearest to Nebellion, and discovered their place in the ‘verse. The whole of gnomish society refocused their efforts, and in another 50 years’ time, the beginnings of the Great Gnomish Flotilla launched from the Nebellion shipyards, carrying seventy-five percent of their population with it.</p>\n<h2>Thinkers and Tinkers</h2>\n<p>The Gnomish Flotilla is almost a million ships strong and houses almost half a trillion inhabitants. Due to small gnomish stature, this suits most of the Flotilla’s inhabitants just fine. Indeed, despite their massive numbers, the Flotilla could support a population twice its current size. The gnomes live in an essentially postscarcity society, and most devote their time and energy to invention, exploration, artistic endeavors, or learning. Surprisingly few true adventurers come out of either the Flotilla or of Nebellion proper, as gnomes tend to be risk-averse if they can afford to be. Still, star gnomes are highly sought-after as ship’s engineers, pilots, and technologists, and their tech is highly valued for its ability to function perfectly in Dead Magic Zones.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The governing body of the star gnomes is split between the Council of Six on Nebellion and the Admiralty of the Flotilla. The Council of Six rules as a democratically elected council comprised of members from each of the six guilds which have governed the planet’s year-to-year workings for centuries: The Craftsman’s Guild (Mechanical and Technological works), The Mason’s Guild (Large Scale Construction works), the Baker’s Guild (Agriculture and Sustainability works), The Traversal Guild (Exploration and Expansion projects), The Windmill Guild (Power Efficiency and Generation projects), and The Artisan’s Guild (Cultural projects and Artworks). Conversely, the Admiralty is governed by the Flotilla’s current Admiral and his subordinate officers. Each ship in the flotilla is like an independent state: free to do as its needs dictate, but still required to report to the Admiral when called.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;While not fully granted citizenship in either the Flotilla or on the Homeworld, most terrestrial gnomes are viewed as star-crossed brethren by the star gnomes. Their natural inclination towards spellcasting (particularly illusion magic) causes some star gnomes to view them with a modicum of suspicion, but most realize that they too would have gravitated towards such pursuits had their world been accommodating.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“<span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Elvish\" data-language=\"elvish\">It took thousands of years of magical study and refinement to develop the Dark Matter engine, and they have the gall to learn how to jump without one?!</span>”</p>\n<p>—— Yathanae Olahorn, exasperated elven shipwright</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/races/star-gnome.png","_id":"b2w7Nl7wbNha33t6"}

In exchange, the dragon parted with a few of its baubles (all legendary magic items), which the founders traded to establish their company.

{"name":"Race - Elves","permission":{"default":0,"PmXouJxFyK2lSXOA":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.alLH2X9fSWKppW8M"}},"content":"<h1>Elves</h1>\n<p>Among the oldest and longest-lived races in the ‘verse, elves were the first to harness their magical skill to extend their reach to the stars above. Svelte, stately, and regal to a fault, elves often view themselves as the true masters of the galaxy, a perspective which has sparked innumerable conflicts in ages past. While they are not physically much different from terrestrial elves (save for their tremendously long lifespans), elves of the ‘verse are often referred to as “Star Elves” due to their wildly different outlook and their connection to the great stellar houses.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Unlike the elven races of more isolated worlds, star elves are not split down genetic or racial lines; rather, they have deliberately self-separated into fantastically prominent Great Houses, or families, each of which claims sole residence of one of the planets in the elven home system. These separate families modify themselves to assume the traits of traditional elven subraces. In this way, even though star elves long ago homogenized to a single appearance, every variation of elf can still be found among their ranks. Their austere focus on house and family, while unifying, has also led to notoriously strict traditions regarding naming, relationships, and procreation.</p>\n<h3>Rise of an Empire</h3>\n<p>Of all the major galactic alliances, the Elven Empire holds the largest territory. Hundreds of life-bearing systems and thousands of planets live under their rule, each a mirror of the glory that is the homeworld. While orderly, well maintained, and generally free of pirates and other ne’erdo-wells, elven imperial space is often regarded as stifling and still dangerous for most non-elven spacers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;To those that cross into elven space, adherence to the law of the throne is paramount. While the High Elves of Deuxcator are celebrated as masterful negotiators and diplomats, they are also decried for their iron-fisted rule and brutal censorship. The last thing any free spacer wishes on an enemy is a trip to an elven prison colony.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In a surprising turn, vect are allowed both complete autonomy and full citizenship on any world in the empire, a lingering gesture of thanks for their support during the Night Crusade. It is not a gift most vect take up fully, but it has generated much goodwill between the races since the war.</p>\n<h3>The Rite of Naming</h3>\n<p>All elves of the empire proper are born or reared on Uneara, second planet in the Etilion system. During the first hundred years of their lives, “newborn” elves are taught the ways and traditions of their people—educated in all manner of magic, sciences, art, combat, and other properly-elven studies. In addition, they are rigorously tested and sorted into the elven Great House best suited for their particular talents.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;By tradition, the Rite of Naming also adapts elves for their house by means of a series of powerful transmutation spells. Ostensibly, these spells are meant only to imbue a physical change on the elves’ skin, returning their appearances to the traditional elven ancestors from each of the Etilion planets, but in practice, it helps cement elves into their houses for the rest of their days.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>High Elves</em>. Those who display aptitude in the magical arts, rhetoric, and diplomacy, in addition to exuding lordly manner, enter the great house Mala’Fiil, and may take up residence on Deuxcator, third planet in the Etilion system. Deuxcator is the seat of power for the elven empire, and all emperors and empresses of the empire have been of Great House Mala’Fiil. Furthermore, Deuxcator is home to the Elven War College and is the center of the empire’s military might. Elves in this house are normally referred to as High Elves.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Wood Elves</em>. Those displaying scientific aptitude in addition to an inborn connection to nature are named to Great House Molo’tak and are moved to Troisha, fourth planet in the Etilion system. Here, these Wood Elves are taught the secrets of growing and carving the empire’s Forest-Fleet of tree-ships from colossal ironwood trees. While the empire has many other worlds from which it supplies its fleet, the greatest of its shipyards is the whole of Troisha.</p>\n<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp;Fey Elves</em>. Elves talented in high magics and deemed to have a connection to the Feywild, the realm from which elvenkind originated, are named to Great House Mere’gaal. Carto, sixth planet in the Etilion system houses these Fey Elves and the empire's grand libraries and magical vaults. While all star elves are naturally gifted in magic, the fey elves of Carto have the natural advantage of living on a homeworld that directly intersects a galactic ley line, greatly enhancing their powers.</p>\n<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp;Drow</em>. Lastly, those who exhibit a talent for subterfuge, stealth, and shadow magics are named to Great House Miri’tesh, and given home on Siink, the ninth and furthest planet from the Etilion sun. The Rite of Naming induces incredible changes in elves of House Miri’tesh, darkening their skin to jet-black and bleaching their hair to ivory white. Outside elven space, most refer to them as Drow, though that name carries no meaning in the empire. The dark elves of Miri’tesh serve as the empire’s spymasters, assassins, and shock troopers, as well as deep space exploration and tracking experts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Houseless</em>. Despite the total commitment expected of each and every elf to the Empire and their house, there are those who choose to break from their familial lines and never undergo the Rite of Naming. In the end, the same fate lies in store for each: total servitude to the other houses as a Houseless, exile from elven space if their servitude is not absolute, and death if exile is refused.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Due to the strictness of the House system, breeding amongst the elves is a highly controlled affair. New elves may only be conceived and born on appropriate worlds in elven space, and must be transported within 10 years of their birth to Uneara for schooling and assessment, lest they be cast out. Children born outside these confines are either torn from their families and consigned as Houseless or are purged from the empire; the same is true of half-elves and planetouched born in elven space. Those isolated elves who are found native to a colonized elven world are sorted and sent to their respective new homes for a minimum of 50 years before being integrated into star elf society, or are purged if they refuse.</p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/races/star-fey-elf.jpg","_id":"ha2BO5OEAakdbZxR"}

These laws listed every conceivable crime, but had no punishments: Saint Vincent&rsquo;s cudgel would be the sole arbiter of all sin.

Long after the nautilids discovered Dark Matter technology and started traversing the universe, disaster struck their homeworld, Poseidon, a vast planet of endless ocean.

And as such, they are universally feared and despised.</p>\n<h2>Imperfect Rogue</h2>\n<p>Most consider wrothians to be wholly evil, an utter scourge of the Black; but by some providence, you were born different. Like all wrothian drones, you are created imperfect, using a fraction of the bio-matter allotted to the unholy primarchs. These primarchs rule over your kind, commanding you to go to the small, pale worlds below and take people to harvest their bio-matter and brains.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Perhaps you were exiled from your ship for demonstrating some act of mercy, or perhaps you escaped to free yourself from the oppressive primarch regime. Regardless, you are now a Rogue, an enemy of all wroth and feared by all others.</p>\n<h2>Few Friends, Many Enemies</h2>\n<p>As a wrothian, there is no bastion you can call home, and you have no natural allies in the &lsquo;verse. Depending on the circumstances of your exile, it is even possible you will be hunted by your former brethren.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;You might find company with groups of mercenaries and among adventuring parties which value your particular skills. Spacers tend to be wary around wrothians and wrothian technology, but, especially on the Galactic Frontier where hazards are abundant, a wrothian might be able to earn a crew&rsquo;s trust, provided they can prove their worth as an ally.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Most rogue wrothians, however, use disguises; usually of magical caliber. Even a simple disguise self spell can reliably masquerade a wrothian as another exotic species, such as a nautilid or skath&aacute;ri, for a time.</p>\n<h2>Awaiting Oblivion</h2>\n<p>In abandoning your life with the wroth, you have forsaken your immortality. Without the refreshment of psionic energy found on their ships, your body will break down and die in less than a decade. Perhaps this death will be a mercy to you, a final correction of your life's mistake, or perhaps you will seek some darker alternative to the oblivion that is death. At long last, however, your life's objective is your own, your destiny free to decide.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Wrothian\" data-language=\"wrothian\">&ldquo;Fly, fools! The primarchs have ordered that this system be harvested! Do not let my warning be in vain...&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p>&mdash;&mdash; Aa'xooras, wrothian exile</p>\n</blockquote>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/races/wrothian.png","_id":"jjSPICzSX4pJ24Tb"}
{"_id":"kU0JKXMMDTxZvwKF","name":"Race - Avia-Ra","permission":{"default":0,"PmXouJxFyK2lSXOA":3},"folder":"","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.rwMDdw3fWs5U2qA7"}},"content":"<h1>Avia-Ra</h1>\n<p>The bird-headed avia-ra might almost be confused for humans from the neck down, but unlike the scores of nearhumans that pervade the galaxy, the avia-ra are unrelated to humanity. Hailing from Kemet, a harsh, desert planet, crisscrossed by rivers and lakes, they have always known an appreciation for the sun’s blessings and cruelties, which forms the backbone of their religion, inspires their arts and sciences, and informs their view of the cosmos. Their dogma centers squarely on their deity and holy star, the Sun Above, to which there can be no equal. When the avia-ra took their first tentative steps into spaceflight, however, their religion bent and adapted to the wider universe in which they found themselves. Suddenly, their Sun Above was no longer Deshret, the star around which their homeworld orbits, but a theoretical “true star” from which all stars, including their own, derive meaning. It was centuries before they ventured to the center of the galaxy and encountered what they consider the physical embodiment of the Sun Above: the Sepulcher Star.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; In those days, the Sepulcher Star orbited much further from the black hole at the galactic core, and it was definitively under elven control. The avia-ra soon learned from the elves that the Sepulcher Star wasn't merely a star, but contained some sort of supermassive construct within. Though strictly an academic curiosity to the elves, this discovery galvanized the avia-ra: in the heart of this star, near the exact center of the galaxy, was their Sun Above. Over the next few centuries, the avia-ra quietly bolstered and gathered their fleets in preparation for the First Crusade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; This was the first of many Crusades, bloody battles between the avia-ra and the elves for control of the center of the galaxy. Each crusade was punctuated with the signing of a treaty, a respite from battle, and a consolidation of forces. Always, a surprise attack by one of the two sides reignited the conflict anew. In the Third Crusade, the avia-ra constructed the massive Solar Citadel in orbit around the Sepulcher Star—a holy city, built for the glory of the Sun Above and to deter elven aggression. In short order, it was seized by an elven sneak attack; ever since, the Citadel has become a flashpoint for conflict and a central focus for Crusades.</p>\n<h3>The Night Crusade</h3>\n<p>The most recent of these battles, called the Night Crusade, nearly saw the wholesale destruction of the Elven Empire. The holy avia-ra fleet, known as the Congregation, captured the center of the galaxy in a series of decisive victories and pushed the elves back to their home system. In this moment, the balance of the galaxy was threatened, and the elves struck a bargain: in exchange for their assistance, the elves would liberate the vect across their empire—a move which would eventually pave the way for vect freedom across the ‘verse.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The culmination of this deal was at the Battle of Alden’val, where the vect fleet turned the tide for the elves, critically wounding the avia-ra’s flagship, The Prophet. The ensuing retreat made an opening for the Elven Forest-Fleet, which encircled the Congregation, spelling the end of the Crusade. The war ended with the signing of the Treaty Black, a document that quieted hostilities and established the Order of the Sepulcher to safeguard against similar crises in the future.</p>\n<h3>Depths of Dogma</h3>\n<p>To some, the avia-ra’s captivating dogma, high priesthood, and Congregation warfleet represent a light and peace in the ‘verse, but to others, it represents a simmering kettle, just waiting to boil over.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In the past, the avia-ra have found little success spreading the message of the Sun Above to the established races of the 'verse. After all, their pantheons are extensive and integral to their societies; a monotheistic god has little place among them. Instead, the avia-ra have turned to primitive civilizations, especially those on undiscovered planets, with which to share their message.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The pattern for their evangelism is simple: build a civilization on an undeveloped world, founded on the philosophy of their solar religion, reside with it long enough to ensure it leaves a lasting legacy, and depart once again for the stars. In the avia-ra religion, all worship of the sun is indirectly worship of the Sun Above, so any evolution their gods of light and flame take on with the passing of centuries is inconsequential; they are still effigies of Old Un in the Sepulcher Star.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;This practice is controversial, to say the least. Many worlds have ancient tales of travelers from other worlds, bringing with them the blessings of the Sun, and these depictions paint them much like gods themselves. Humans, especially, have a sore spot for this sort of unfair proselytizing—High Terra was an early target for avia-ra evangelists. Elves and dwarves hold their own pantheons as sacred, and condemn avia-ra missionaries as a whole, but there is little that the galactic community can do, short of inciting galactic war. Thus, avia-ra evangelism occupies an uncomfortable, but tolerated position in the galaxy.</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Avia-Ra\" data-language=\"avia-ra\"><em>Upon the Black and Night Crusade,</em></span><br><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Avia-Ra\" data-language=\"avia-ra\">Rode the fearless, heroes they.</span><br><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Avia-Ra\" data-language=\"avia-ra\">Citadel, unto their grasp,</span><br><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Avia-Ra\" data-language=\"avia-ra\">Fleets adjoined; O' pilgrim's wrath.</span><br><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Avia-Ra\" data-language=\"avia-ra\">Prostrate ‘fore the Sun Above,</span><br><span class=\"polyglot-journal\" title=\"Avia-Ra\" data-language=\"avia-ra\">All to arms – never love.</span></p>\n<p><em>— 3rd Hymn of the Night Crusade</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The avia-ra are a sun-worshipping race of wingless birdmen, which appear to primitive cultures to spread their ancient religion.</p>\n<h2>Ancient God-Kings</h2>\n<p>Depictions of the avia-ra can be found in the ruins of ancient cultures throughout the galaxy. Often, but not always, they are portrayed as divinity manifest: god-like travelers from the heavens. They arrive as evangelists to share the philosophy of their solar religion—that the Sun Above is the only true god—and remain long enough to build an enduring civilization on the primitive world.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Some races consider the avia-ra an ancient and wise people, dedicated to their religion and its tenets. Others cast them as charlatans and false prophets, who routinely prey upon primitive and defenseless peoples. The truth depends largely on perspective, but the avia-ra view themselves only as a grand tool to carry the momentum of the sun's glory to new peoples.</p>\n<h2>Watchers of the Citadel</h2>\n<p>The heart of the avia-ra's religion is at the Solar Citadel, which revolves close around the Sepulcher Star. Most aviara make pilgrimage to this site at least once in their lives to bask in the rays of their holy sun, which (in their philosophy) gives light and meaning to all other stars. Their worship of the sun is always directed at the Sepulcher Star itself, even if they are nearer to another star or to no star at all. All other stars merely act as a metaphor, a symbol, for their holy sun.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In contrast to their binary doctrines, their actual relationship to the star and the Sepulcher within it is more complicated. The Solar Citadel definitively ensures that the star is under avia-ra control, but Old Un has never spoken to the avia-ra directly from within the star. Despite the silence, the avia-ra continue to pray in reverence and make pilgrimage to the Sepulcher Star.</p>\n<h2>Deep Symbolism</h2>\n<p>Avia-Ra are inclined to view the events around them as omens of much larger struggles, such as those between light and dark, good and evil, and law and chaos. All things have symbolic importance to them; even fundamentally objective things like science and mathematics have a place in the underlying allegory for avia-ra.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Most avia-ra hold dreams in especially high regard, for interpreted dreams can tell the future, lend insight into the past, or provide guidance for the present. Those with the gift to interpret dreams are honored highly as priestsin the avia-ra and given elaborate titles, such as Grand Remembrancer, or Dream-Teller Most High.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/races/avia-ra.jpg"}
{"_id":"qIvrVCOfvq6zkXDu","name":"Chapter 6: Ships - Ship Combat","permission":{"default":0,"PmXouJxFyK2lSXOA":3},"folder":"","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.oTqHu3oEMVnxJMZ7"}},"content":"<div title=\"Page 194\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h1>Ship Combat</h1>\n<p>Combat between starships is a deadly and unforgiving game, for the loser is subjected to the lifeless, infinite void of space.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ship combat follows most of the same rules and conventions as ordinary combat; for example, ships follow an initiative order and generally play on a 2D plane.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ship movement is covered in the Pilot role and ship attacks are covered in the Gunner role. The Captain, Dogfighter, and Engineer roles are optional; a captain provides extra actions to the crew, the engineer manages power flow and shields, and a dogfighter detaches from the main ship to target the weak points on enemy craft.</p>\n<h2>Initiative</h2>\n<p>When ship combat begins, each character must take a role on the ship to participate. A character's actions with regards to the ship are limited to the role they choose. Entire enemy ships act on a single turn of the initiative order, whereas individual characters act separately. However, if a character is in the role of the Captain, the entire crew can act on a single turn of the initiative order.</p>\n<h2>Character Roles</h2>\n<p>Each character on a starship chooses one of the following roles when they roll initiative. Depending on the ship, some roles, such as Gunner, might be occupied by one character, more than one character, or might not exist at all. By contrast, roles like Pilot are usually occupied only by one character.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A character can switch roles with another character or can switch to an unoccupied role as an action.</p>\n<h3>Captain</h3>\n<p>As the captain, you direct the ship's operations and manage the crew. If you choose to be the captain when the ship rolls initiative, you roll initiative for the entire ship. The entire party acts on that turn in the initiative order while you are captain, and you can choose in which order the crew members take their turns. If you leave the Captain role or fall unconscious, the party rolls initiative separately at the end of the next initiative order.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a captain, you can use the following actions:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Boarding Party</em></strong>. When the conditions for Boarding are met, you can use your action as the captain to form a boarding party (which you can choose to be a part of) and deploy the umbilicus.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong><em>Brace for Impact</em></strong>. You can use your action to brace the ship for damage. Each time your ship takes damage before the beginning of your next turn, you can roll 1d6 and subtract the number rolled from the mega damage your ship takes, to a minimum of 1.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div title=\"Page 194\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Deep Scan</strong></em>. If your ship is equipped with sensors, you can use your action to order a deep scan of a specific object of interest within range of the sensors. This allows you to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check to examine that object.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Fire at Will</strong></em>. You use your action to declare a barrage. One gunner of your choice can then use its reaction to make one attack with a ship weapon.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Full Speed Ahead</strong></em>. You use your action to push the engines. The pilot can then use its reaction to move the ship half its movement within the cone of movement.</p>\n<h3>Dogfighter</h3>\n<p>You deploy in a lighter, more maneuverable vessel to disable enemy fighters and target the vital locations of hostile ships. You can use your action to launch your fighter-sized ship from the main ship or to dock with it while you are adjacent to it. You can only switch roles while your fighter is docked with the main ship.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once launched, you can move your fighter's entire speed on its turn and use your action to fire its weapons. Movement and weapon attacks follow the same rules<br />as the Pilot&rsquo;s Move action and the Gunner&rsquo;s Open Fire action, except that moving your fighter doesn't require an action. You can also take the Pilot&rsquo;s Dogfighting action.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your fighter drops to 0 hit points and is destroyed, you can use your reaction to eject from the craft in a life pod to survive the explosion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While acting as a dogfighter, you can take the following special action:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Targeted Attack</strong></em>. While you are within 1,000 feet of another ship, you can use your action to attempt to disable one of that ship&rsquo;s systems. When you do so, make an attack targeting the ship with disadvantage. On a hit, you deal damage directly to a system of your choice, a weapon of your choice, or the ship&rsquo;s impulse engines. If the attack is blocked by a shield, the damage is subtracted from the target ship&rsquo;s shield points before it damages any system. Systems, weapons, and engines have 10 mega hit points each. Damage to systems is also deducted from the target ship&rsquo;s hit points.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a system or weapon drops to 0 hit points, it is disabled. Any creature operating a weapon when it is destroyed takes normal damage (as opposed to mega damage) equal to the damage dealt. If the engines drop to 0 hit points, the ship is crippled and can only move at half speed.</p>\n<h3>Engineer</h3>\n<p>As the engineer, you can direct power around the ship and position the ship's directional shield. By default, the shield is forward-facing and active.</p>\n<p>The ship's shield covers only one of the ship's four sides. As a bonus action, you can switch the direction the shield faces. If an attack hits the ship on its shielded side, damage is subtracted from the ship's shield points, rather than its hit points.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the initiative order, the shield regains half its maximum shield points, rounded up.</p>\n<p>As an engineer, you have the following actions available to you:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Directing Power</strong></em>. You can use your action to deactivate the shield and direct its power elsewhere: either to the impulse engines or into one of the ship&rsquo;s weapons. If you invest the power in the ship&rsquo;s engines, the ship&rsquo;s movement speed increases by half until the beginning of your next turn. If you invest the power in one of the ship&rsquo;s weapons, a gunner can make one additional attack using that weapon when they take the Open Fire action.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can draw power from the ship&rsquo;s weapons and invest it in the ship's shields. When you do so, until the beginning of your next turn, the ship's shields&nbsp;cover two of its consecutive sides, instead of only one, and it regains all of its shield points at the beginning of the initiative order, instead of only half. In exchange, each gunner makes one weapon attack fewer than normal when they take the Open Fire action.</p>\n<div title=\"Page 195\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<p><em><strong>Overcharge</strong></em>. If you are a spellcaster, you can use your action to expend a spell slot with a level greater than or equal to the Dark Matter engine's class to overcharge the engine. The shield recharges completely, and until the beginning of your next turn, power is invested in the ship&rsquo;s engines (increasing the ship&rsquo;s movement speed by half) and every gun (allowing each gunner to make one additional attack using that weapon when they take the Open Fire action on their turn). Once you use this ability, you can&rsquo;t use it again for 1 minute.</p>\n<p><em><strong>System Repair</strong></em>. You can use your action to repair a ship system or weapon that has 0 hit points and is deactivated. When you do so, make a DC 15 Intelligence (Technology) check. On a success, the system or weapon regains 1 mega hit point and reactivates at the beginning of your next turn.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Void Jump</strong></em>. You can begin the charging process for a void jump. Once a Dark Matter engine has begun to charge, it will jump in 1 minute. No intervention can stop or slow this process; once it is begun, nothing short of destroying the ship can interrupt the jump. The pilot is responsible for guiding the ship on the jump itself and rolls on the Jump Navigation table when the jump begins.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div title=\"Page 196\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h3>Gunner&nbsp;</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div title=\"Page 194\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div title=\"Page 196\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Acquiring targets and calculating ranges, you fire the shipboard weapons on hostile targets. Many ship weapons don't have any facing rules, but those which do are normally mounted to the front or to one of the sides of the ship. If a weapon has the Facing property, it can only be fired in a 90-degree cone in the direction in which it was mounted.</p>\n<p>While you are in the Gunner role, you can only operate one of the ship&rsquo;s weapons at a time. You can use a bonus action on your turn to switch between weapons.</p>\n<p>You add your proficiency bonus and Dexterity modifier to an attack roll you make with a ship&rsquo;s weapon, but you don't add any ability modifier to the weapon&rsquo;s damage rolls. Weapon entries in the Example Ships section include an example attack bonus, to be used only if the GM controls the ship as an NPC.</p>\n<p>As a gunner, you can take the following actions:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Open Fire</strong></em>. You can take the Attack action on your turn to attack with one of the ship&rsquo;s weapons. You can make multiple attacks with this weapon if you have a feature, such as Extra Attack, that gives you extra attacks.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Readied Attacks</strong></em>. You can use your action to ready an attack with a ship&rsquo;s weapon, just as you would ready an attack with a normal weapon. Often, this readied action is used to target deployed weapons, such as neutron torpedoes, the moment they are launched, or to strike another ship the moment it opens fire.</p>\n<h3>Pilot</h3>\n<p>As the pilot, you navigate and direct the ship's movement. Each ship has a given speed in hundreds of feet per turn, and a maneuverability score, which is given in degrees. Additionally, each ship faces a particular direction, which is normally in 45-degree intervals, and can be approximated using the eight cardinal directions.</p>\n<p>To approximate momentum, each ship's movement is limited to a cone of movement, which extends in the direction your ship is facing and is as wide as the ship&rsquo;s Maneuverability score, measured in degrees.</p>\n<p>As the ship&rsquo;s pilot, you can use the following special actions:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Move</strong></em>. You use your action to move the ship up to its speed within the ship&rsquo;s cone of movement. Once you have finished moving, you can rotate the direction your ship is facing by up to its maneuverability score.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Evasive Maneuvers</strong></em>. If your ship is Corvette-sized or smaller, you can use your action to perform evasive maneuvers instead of moving normally. When you do&nbsp;so, until the beginning of your next turn, you add your Dexterity modifier to the ship's AC and have advantage on Dexterity saving throws you make on behalf of the ship.</p>\n<div title=\"Page 196\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p><em><strong>Dogfighting</strong></em>. If your ship is Corvette-sized or smaller and a ship of the same size classification is behind you within 1,000 feet, you can use your action to perform a complex maneuver. Make a Dexterity (Piloting) check, contested by the other ship. On a success, following several tight turns, you switch places with that ship. The direction both ships face remains the same.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Hard Turn</strong></em>. If your ship is Corvette-sized or smaller, you can use your action to pull a hard turn, rotating your ship almost on the spot. You move your ship 500 feet in any direction and rotate to face any way you choose.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Match Speed</strong></em>. Your ship attempts to move at the same rate and direction as another ship instead of moving normally. Choose one ship that you can see. Until the beginning of your next turn, your ship moves when that ship does and attempts to maintain the same distance from it and angle to it. If the target ship moves faster, is more maneuverable, or uses Hard Turn to perform a movement you are not normally capable of, this effect ends.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Ram</strong></em>. If your ship is Frigate-sized or smaller (and you feel particularly foolhardy), you can ram your ship directly into a target by moving up to your speed within your cone of movement and entering a ship or mega creature&rsquo;s space. Your ship and the target each take 2d10 mega bludgeoning damage. Larger ships deal and take more damage in a ram: Transport ships deal 3d10, Corvettes and Frigates deal 4d10.</p>\n<h3>Damage and Repair</h3>\n<p>A ship&rsquo;s hit points are given in mega points and ship- based weapons usually deal damage in mega points as well. Optionally, the GM can rule that non-mega damage can&rsquo;t affect things which have mega hit points, and that mega damage is instantly lethal to non-mega targets.</p>\n<p>When a ship takes hit point damage, it represents structural damage to its hull which is not easily repaired. The loss of hit points has no effect on a ship&rsquo;s capabilities until the ship drops to 0 hit points. Individual systems and weapons, however, can be disabled by precision strikes, which is separate from normal hit point damage.</p>\n<p>Ships are immune to poison and psychic damage.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Shield Points</strong></em>. If a ship has a shield generator, hit<br />point damage might instead be subtracted from the ship&rsquo;s shield points (SP), which are measured in mega hit points. Shields only cover a part of a ship, normally only one side. If the shortest line from an attacker to a shielded ship lands on a shielded side (or a corner of a shielded side), damage is subtracted from the ship's shield points, rather&nbsp;than its hit points. If an attack reduces the shield to 0 shield points, any excess damage carries over to hit points.</p>\n<div title=\"Page 197\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>A ship with a shield regains half its maximum shield points, rounded up, at the beginning of the engineer&rsquo;s turn (or the start of the initiative order, if the ship has no engineer).</p>\n<h3>Destruction</h3>\n<p>When a ship drops to 0 hit points, it becomes a blazing wreck. All of its systems, including weapons, engines, and life support, cease to function, and it can&rsquo;t regain hit points. Escape craft, like fighters, life pods, and shuttles can still eject from a blazing wreck. The ship is on a tipping point of complete disaster; it might soon explode outright, or otherwise become a derelict wreck.</p>\n<p>Explosion Saving Throws. If the ship is a blazing wreck at the end of the initiative order, one character makes a unique saving throw, called an explosion saving throw. This saving throw isn&rsquo;t tied to any ability score; it is purely dependent on chance.</p>\n<p>Roll a [[/r d20]]. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, the ship becomes a derelict wreck; it is adrift, and all its systems are still disabled, but it is no longer at risk of exploding and can, with extensive efforts, be repaired. On your third failure, the ship explodes, immediately killing any creatures still onboard. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind.</p>\n<p>Damage at 0 Hit Points. If your ship takes any damage while it is a blazing wreck, it suffers an explosion saving throw failure.</p>\n<h3>Repair</h3>\n<p>Repairing a ship is a difficult process requiring many hours of work. During your downtime, you can perform repairs on your ship. For each day you spend performing repairs, you make a DC 15 Intelligence (Technology) check. If you have proficiency in ship maintenance tools, you can add your proficiency bonus to the check, or double your proficiency bonus if you are also proficient with Technology. On a success, the ship regains mega hit points equal to your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. Alternatively, the ship can be repaired completely in one day at port for a fee of 2 gp per mega hit point lost.</p>\n<h3>Boarding</h3>\n<p>Sometimes, your objective in ship-to-ship combat requires that you come aboard a hostile vessel. You can board another vessel if your ship has an umbilicus, if both ships are within 500 feet of each other, and if the pilot of your ship has Matched Speed with the other. When you do so,&nbsp;any number of crew members or passengers can join a boarding party. The umbilicus only remains attached as long as both ships remain within 500 feet of each other.</p>\n<div title=\"Page 197\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>A boarding party and any hostile crew roll their own initiative which acts parallel to ongoing ship combat. Combat as a boarding party is the same as normal combat.</p>\n<p>The boarding party arrives in a room via the umbilicus and can only return to their own ship through the umbilicus. The captain or engineer of the opposing ship can disengage life support (or choose to only deactivate gravity, atmosphere, or heat) or start a self-destruct timer on the ship. Additionally, if the boarding party accesses important locations, such as the engine room, the shield generator, or a battle station housing a ship weapon, they can use the opportunity to destroy or disable the ship's various systems and weapons.</p>\n<p>If the party eliminates all hostile crew members of the boarded ship, they can commandeer it, provided that they have a knowledgeable pilot and enough crew to operate it.</p>\n<h3>NPC Ships</h3>\n<p>The GM doesn't play the individual roles of an NPC ship separately. Rather, each NPC ship rolls its own initiative and can perform all its relevant actions on its turn. In addition, rather than calculating the statistics of gunners, NPC ships use the attack bonuses included in weapon entries and typically have one gunner at each weapon. The GM also decides the relevant ability checks and saving throws for NPC crewmen.</p>\n<p>If an NPC ship has a Captain role, the GM can also allow the ship to take an additional action on its turn.</p>\n<p>Most GMs have NPC ships immediately explode when dropping to 0 hit points. Common exceptions include when one or more player characters has boarded the ship, or when an important NPC or villain is aboard it. Alternatively, the GM can rule that the characters in question escape aboard a life pod or a shuttle shortly before the ship&rsquo;s explosion.</p>\n<h3>Variant Rule: Grid Combat</h3>\n<p>Ship combat is particularly well-suited to using miniatures on a square-based grid map. Using this rule, each square is 500 feet by 500 feet and each ship faces the side or the corner of their surrounding squares. Ships of Transport size or smaller fit within a single square. On its turn, a ship moves 1 square for every 500 feet of its movement.</p>\n<p>When counting distance on a grid, the first diagonal square counts as 1 square of movement, and the second diagonal square as 2 squares. Repeat this pattern of 1 square, 2 squares whenever you count diagonally, even if you move horizontally or vertically between different bits of movement.</p>\n<div title=\"Page 198\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h3>Variant Rule: Planes of Movement</h3>\n<p>Though ship combat primarily takes place on a 2D plane, you can use this variant rule to convert combat into a semblance of 3D space. When combat begins, the GM decides how many Planes of Movement exist.

This chapter details how to use Dark Matter engines, ship statistics, crew roles, ship combat, and space exploration. Additionally, it includes a plethora of ship options.</p>\n<h2>Ship Traits</h2>\n<p>The common saying goes: \"No two ships in the 'verse are alike.\" Though any mechanic will tell you that this isn't exactly true, the meld of magic and technology spacefaring vessels employ to cross the gulfs of space vary in thousands of ways. Even ships laid down in the same yard to the same specification are likely to go through multiple refits, overhauls, and repairs during their lives, leaving them unrecognizable after a few years in the Black. For most purposes, ships are described by statistics which include the following information:</p>\n<p>Size classification, hit points, shield points, Armor Class, engines, systems, crew, cargo, cost, challenge, and<br />weapons, all of which are detailed below.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More details for how these statistics are used can be found in the Ship Combat section.</p>\n<h3>Size Classification</h3>\n<p>Ships are categorized according to their <strong>Size Classification</strong>, which generally determines other important aspects: its crew size, top speed outside of void jumps, maneuverability, and durability. For example, a larger ship might be able to carry more men and guns, but a smaller ship can outrun and outmaneuver it. Different size classifications are detailed in the Size Classification table below.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ships also mention which race generally builds that type of ship. This has no mechanical effect on its own; instead, it gives an impression about which types of creatures might be piloting them, and what statistics you can expect from that type of ship. For example, Hammers, which are dwarven fighters, are sturdily built, and possess a higher Armor Class than many other fighters as a result.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, the Ship Classification table indicates the size of a ship in feet and its size using the optional Grid Combat rules. The sizes listed are maximum sizes.</p>\n<h4>Character Level</h4>\n<p>A typical adventuring party might begin their adventures with a modest personal ship and invest in larger, more capable vessels as their fortunes grow. Larger parties, however, will find the cargo space and crew capacity of a transport ship essential. At very high levels, characters might enlist a crew to man a frigate or even an entire fleet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, a party&rsquo;s character level has no bearing on ship size (and by extension, ship combat power), but a GM can award a party with larger ships as they grow in level. As such, the Ship Classification table also includes a recommended character level for some ship sizes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"width: 638px;\" border=\"0\" width=\"426\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><colgroup><col style=\"width: 138.5px;\" width=\"93\" /> <col style=\"width: 161.5px;\" width=\"121\" /> <col style=\"width: 186.5px;\" width=\"143\" /> <col style=\"width: 148.5px;\" width=\"69\" /> </colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl65\" style=\"height: 15.0pt; mso-ignore: colspan; width: 161pt;\" colspan=\"2\" width=\"214\" height=\"20\">\n<h2><em>Dark Matter Ship Classifications</em></h2>\n</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 107pt;\" width=\"143\">\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n</td>\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"width: 52pt;\" width=\"69\">\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl68\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">\n<h3>Classification</h3>\n</td>\n<td class=\"xl69\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">\n<h3>Dimensions (feet)</h3>\n</td>\n<td class=\"xl69\" style=\"width: 107pt;\" width=\"143\">\n<h3>Dimensions (squares)</h3>\n</td>\n<td class=\"xl68\">\n<h3>Rec.

If you&rsquo;re not sure how to create new stats or how to interpret an effect happening at starship scale, remember that hit points and<br />damage (which use mega points), movement speed, and ship scale are generally scaled up by 100 times. This can provide a good rule of thumb when a quick decision is necessary at the table.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<h3>Armor Class</h3>\n<p>Like creatures and structures, ships have an Armor Class (AC). Unlike creatures, however, a ship&rsquo;s Armor Class is&nbsp;&nbsp; perfectly literal: it represents how heavily armored a ship is and determines how successful an attack is likely to be.</p>\n<h3>Mega Hit Points</h3>\n<p>The damage necessary to injure and kill the hardiest of men is paltry compared to the durability and lethality of&nbsp; an entire starship. Therefore, ships use Mega Hit Points, instead of regular hit points, to describe their damage and repair. A single mega hit point equals 100 hit points. A ship&rsquo;s hit points represent the resilience of its hull.</p>\n<h3>Shield Points</h3>\n<p>In addition to hit points, many ships have Shield Points, (expressed in mega points) which determine how much damage can be absorbed by the ship's shield. Shields are always created by a shield generator system and are controlled by the ship&rsquo;s engineer.</p>\n<h3>Engines</h3>\n<p>Ships generally have two Engine types, a Dark Matter engine to perform void jumps, and an Impulse engine, used to maneuver when not in the Void. Each impulse engine has a given Speed in hundreds of feet per turn and a Maneuverability score, measured in degrees, which determines a ship's cone of movement. More information about engines can be found in the Dark Matter Engines section, and more information about movement can be found in the Ship Combat section.</p>\n<h3>Systems</h3>\n<p>Everything from essentials, like a ship&rsquo;s life support or sensors, to peripheral functions, like tractor beams and teleporters are encapsulated in a ship&rsquo;s Systems. The list of systems available to a ship are detailed in the Systems section.</p>\n<h3>Crew</h3>\n<p>The ship's Crew indicates the roles that are available to characters in the ship. If a Dogfighter role is available, the entry in parentheses indicates the default type of ship that the dogfighters pilot. For more information on how to use the crew roles, see the Ship Combat section. Note that most ships will have room for passengers that won't actively take a role in ship combat.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the need arises, a ship can temporarily take on more passengers than it can safely support. Doing so taxes the life-support, however, and can only be performed for a short time. For each day that the ship is above its passenger capacity, every passenger onboard gains one level of exhaustion. These levels of exhaustion can&rsquo;t be removed by those aboard until the ship is once again below capacity.</p>\n<h3>Cargo</h3>\n<p>Each ship has a fixed Cargo capacity, which indicates the amount of cargo the ship can carry.</p>\n<h3>Cost</h3>\n<p>Most ships can be bought and sold at docks and starports throughout the &lsquo;verse, and therefore have an included Cost. This price is a typical figure for a ship of its type, but unscrupulous (or simply ignorant) merchants might sell ships for a far higher or far lower price.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not all ships have an included cost; the very largest and most powerful of ships are ostensibly priceless and are never bought or sold at market.</p>\n<h3>Challenge</h3>\n<p>Like monsters, ships have a Challenge rating to help GMs compose challenging encounters using them. When determining encounter difficulty, it is best to use the average of the party&rsquo;s level and their ship&rsquo;s challenge rating as the party&rsquo;s effective level.</p>\n<h3>Weapons</h3>\n<p>Ship-mounted weaponry comes in a bewildering variety of shapes and sizes, from physical battering rams, to extremely large flamethrowers, to deployable mines, but the most common ship-mounted Weapons are based on the same principles as handheld blasters. They are, nonetheless, singularly destructive, capable of melting clean through armored hulls in a single shot.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ship armaments are explained in the Ship Weapons section, with additional details on their use in the Ship Combat section.</p>\n<h2>Dark Matter Engines</h2>\n<p>Spacefaring vessels in the 'verse are abundant and varied, reflecting hundreds of societies and their diverse technologies. Nearly all of them operate via a Dark Matter engine, a solid or latticework crystal structure surrounded by heat sinks, stabilizers, and other supporting equipment. These engines are powered by magic, allowing them to carry a ship on short jumps through the Void to cross vast gulfs of space.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dark Matter engines are the hearts of starships. Most ships also have other engines, called impulse engines, to travel outside of void jumps, but a Dark Matter engine is required to embark on any planet-hopping adventure.</p>\n<h3>Engine Class</h3>\n<p>Dark Matter engines can only jump twice a day, and most can maintain a void jump for only a short time before needing time to cool down and recharge. Therefore, Dark Matter engines are organized into Classes, from 1 &ndash; 9, based upon the length of their jumps. These Classes are detailed in the Dark Matter Engine Classes table.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a spellcaster directly powers the engine using their magic, they can cause a Dark Matter engine to jump two more times on a given day. However, progressively more powerful engines require more arcane magic. A Class 1 engine can be powered by a 1st level spell slot, but a Class 2 engine requires a 2nd level spell slot, and so on.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Engines with the lowest classes are ostensibly systemhoppers, allowing a small starship to jump around a single system, or to go on longer journeys between nearby systems. Often, these types of ships will need to be carried within higher class starships to cross longer distances.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Class 10 engines are strictly theoretical or legendary, depending on who you ask. Such an engine could cross the galaxy in a single day, requiring no spellcasters of any sort, and would have to be the direct creation of the gods, or some ancient, mystical alien race.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"height: 175px;

Rare, fragile, and extracted from the Void at the event horizons of black holes, these crystals are among the most valuable and volatile materials in the 'verse. If a void crystal is damaged in the slightest, it risks not only becoming inoperable, but also collapsing into a <em>sphere of annihilation</em>, destroying the rest of the engine and the entire ship. Thus, most of the stabilizing equipment surrounding the core of a Dark Matter engine serves only to insulate and protect the crystal within.</p>\n<h3>Running a Dark Matter Engine</h3>\n<p>To many, it seems that Dark Matter engines are temperamental and perplexing without end, behaving like living things unto themselves. No single race&rsquo;s designs and no particular model accurately represents the variety of these engines; even engines of the same model act differently when fed different types of magical energy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a ship has long had a warlock working as an engineer, the Dark Matter engine may start to belch clouds of sulfur and brimstone, and charge faster when those aboard the ship are miserable. Wizards, on the other hand, keep rather tidy, if meticulously modified, engines, which are likely to pulse with rhythmic bursts of force when engaged in a jump. The variations are endless: engines run by illusionists chromatically aberrate the air around them, druid-kept engines sprout twigs and grass in their crevices, and some dwarven engines produce a small amount of beer as exhaust.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Charging a Dark Matter Engine</em></strong>. All Dark Matter engines, regardless of type, require significant energy to charge-up before a jump. Older or worn models of engine can take several hours of warm-up time, during which they must be fed a continuous stream of magical energy. In general, assume that an engine requires 1 minute of warm-up time prior to a jump.</p>\n<h2>Ship Weapons</h2>\n<p>Ship-mounted weapons are among the most lethal devices ever conceived. A direct shot with any of these massive weapons can vaporize an unprotected person, but no less is necessary to pierce the armored hull of a starship.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ship-mounted weapons are used by crewmen in the Gunner role. A character with martial weapons proficiency also has proficiency with ship weapons.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ship weapon damages are given in mega damage points.</p>\n<h3>Weapon Descriptions</h3>\n<p>These weapons are installed in ships across the &lsquo;verse, from amoeboid saucers to human warbringers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Auto Turret</em></strong>. This omni-directional twin blaster is fired from a swiveling, domed turret. Because of its rotating mount, the blaster is relatively small compared to other ship-mounted weapons, but it is capable of harrying other vessels from all angles.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Antimatter Mine</strong></em>. Antimatter mines are explosives designed to lay dormant until magnetically attracted to nearby targets. Each mine weighs around 1,000 pounds and are deployed from a launch tube, normally installed near a ship&rsquo;s cargo bay.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Heavy Cannon</strong></em>. Ballistic weapons are uncommon in space combat, but not totally unheard of (and certainly not ineffective). A heavy cannon fires large-diameter explosive shells, which unlike blaster bolts, must lead their target to account for travel time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Light Cannon</em></strong>. Scaled-down versions of heavy cannons, light cannons trade sheer firepower for a faster rate of fire, greater density of stored ammunition, and more flexibility in mounting positions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Lightning Coil</strong></em>. This enormous transformer draws a similarly large amount of power and generates arcs of lightning thousands of feet long. Because the lightning discharges toward any nearby target, the lightning coil is<br />actually omni-directional.</p>\n<p><em><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mining Laser</strong></em>. This laser and its turret deploy from a hatch on the ship, with a blast screen protecting it from loose debris. If allowed to focus on an immobile target, the laser grows hot enough to break chunks from solid asteroids.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Neutron Torpedo</strong></em>. This cigar-shaped missile carries a hefty neutron payload to its target. Unfortunately, the torpedo only carries a limited amount of fuel, limiting its maximum range.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Pulse Cannon</strong></em>. One of the staple fixed-position blasters, the pulse cannon charges an incredible burst of energy in a large capacitor bank, before releasing it in a brilliant flicker of light. This weapon owes its popularity to its balance of firepower and range.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Railgun</strong></em>. Conducting a ferromagnetic projectile down two conductive rails requires a frankly outrageous amount of power, but the results are hard to argue with. A railgun transfers so much kinetic energy into its projectile that it generally degrades into plasma en route to its target.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Scorcher</strong></em>. Scorchers spit a narrow fan of flame from their mouths, normally with the intent of melting through the hulls of other ships or making them malleable enough to warp. Because of this uncouth design, scorchers trade range for the singular ability to bypass shield systems.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Starbuster</em></strong>. Starbusters are the largest blasters ever fashioned. By channeling six component blasters into a single, mighty beam, this weapon can rend entire ships in half. Its scale and power consumption mean that only the grandest of ships can shoulder it; of course, this also means that this weapon is as useful for deterrence as it is for defense.</p>\n<h3>Ship Weapon Properties</h3>\n<p>In addition to weapon properties presented in the Equipment chapter, shipbound weapons have special properties that are unique to their use.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Deployable</strong></em>. A deployable weapon releases a type of ammunition that separates from the ship, which might have a movement speed of its own, noted in parentheses.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you make an attack using one of these weapons, you deploy the weapon within your ship&rsquo;s space. You make an attack roll using this weapon when it contacts another ship.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you use a deployable weapon that has a movement speed, you can choose the direction it travels as a bonus action on your turn. A deployable weapon has a maneuverability of 90 degrees and begins facing in the same direction as the ship. Once a deployable weapon moves for 3 turns, it deactivates and begins drifting listlessly.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deployable weapons can be targeted independently during flight. Each of these weapons has Armor Class 10<br />and 1 mega hit point.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Fixed</strong></em>. This weapon is mounted on one side of a ship and can only make attacks against targets within a 90-degree cone in the direction it is facing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Ship</strong></em>. A ship weapon is powered by a ship and must be mounted to one to fire. This weapon can&rsquo;t target any creature or object that is Huge or smaller.</p>\n<h3>Special Weapons</h3>\n<p>These ship weapons have special properties.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Antimatter Mine</strong></em>. If a ship other than your own with a Dark Matter engine comes within 1,000 feet of this mine, the mine detonates. When this happens, make an attack roll with the mine against the triggering ship.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Lightning Coil</strong></em>. This weapon deals double damage to shield points, but half damage (rounded down) to hit points. If this damage reduces a ship&rsquo;s shields points to 0, remaining damage is not subtracted from hit points.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Mining Laser</strong></em>. This weapon is designed to cut through immobile asteroids and other bodies of rock. It deals double damage to targets that have not moved in the last round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Scorcher</strong></em>. This weapon produces a scorching fan of arcane energy which heats a ship&rsquo;s hull without affecting its shields. Shields do not block this weapon's damage.</p>\n<h3>Ammunition and Deployable Weapons</h3>\n<p>Many ship weapons rely on blaster technology, which are powered strictly by the ship&rsquo;s Dark Matter engine, and don't require ammunition of any sort. Other ship weapons (especially those favored by gnomes) are more closely related to firearms in design and require ammunition, or deploy from the ship and fly independently, almost like separate vehicles. Ammunition and deployable weapons have independent costs and must be purchased separately.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"height: 295px;\" border=\"0\" width=\"659\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><colgroup><col style=\"width: 150px;\" width=\"115\" /><col style=\"width: 58px;\" width=\"121\" /><col style=\"width: 191px;\" width=\"143\" /><col style=\"width: 294px;\" width=\"280\" /></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 15px;\">\n<td class=\"xl68\" style=\"height: 15px;

This is called a broadside attack. When a ship makes a broadside attack, each mega creature and the pilot of each ship in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking full damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Broadside attacks require a gunner, much like other attacks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A broadside attack can only be used once on each round. If a broadside attack is disabled, it can still be used to make an attack, but deals only half damage on a failed saving throw, and no damage on a successful save.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A ship with broadside attacks can&rsquo;t replace them with other ship weapons.</p>\n<h3>Ship Melee Weapons</h3>\n<p>Some ships have tremendous built-in melee weapons, designed to crush, rip, and tear other ships into pieces. For use in especially close range, these weapons can target any other ship or mega creature in an adjacent square (a target within 500 feet). Ship melee weapons can&rsquo;t be replaced like normal ship weapons, nor can they replace normal ship weapons.</p>\n<h2>Systems</h2>\n<p>A ship relies on a myriad of technological systems to provide most of its noncombative functions. All ships have a ship computer which provides executive function to all its other systems, and nearly all possess a life support system.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each system has 10 mega hit points. If a strategic attack on a system reduces it to 0 hit points, it is disabled and doesn't function until it is repaired (generally requiring the work of a trained engineer).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The costs to install new systems are found on the System Costs table below. Additional rules regarding installing new systems are in the Customizing your Ship section.</p>\n<table style=\"width: 231px;\" border=\"0\" width=\"236\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><colgroup><col style=\"width: 147.5px;\" width=\"115\" /> <col style=\"width: 80.5px;\" width=\"121\" /> </colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl65\" style=\"height: 15.0pt; width: 86pt;\" width=\"115\" height=\"20\">\n<h2>System Costs</h2>\n</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl68\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\"><em>System</em></td>\n<td class=\"xl69\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\"><em>Cost</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Arcane Cannon</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">10,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Cloaking</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">16,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Communications</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">1,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Fabricator</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">2,500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Hypercapacitor</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">7,500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Life Pods</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">2,500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Life Support</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">1,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Probe</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">1,500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Sensors</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">1,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Shield Generator</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">5,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Shuttle</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">1,250 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Sickbay</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">5,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Simulator</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">6,250 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Teleporters</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">20,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Tractor Beam</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">10,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15.0pt;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15.0pt;\" height=\"20\">Umbilicus</td>\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"width: 91pt;\" width=\"121\">1,500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Arcane Cannon</h3>\n<p>This immensely sophisticated station focuses and magnifies a spellcaster&rsquo;s power, allowing them to cast spells that lay waste to entire fleets. To use an arcane cannon, you must be a spellcaster and be in the Gunner role. The cannon allows you to see ships as if you were on the bridge, which enables you to target ships with spells.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To use the arcane cannon, you must first use your action to charge it for one round. Charging the cannon doesn't expend a spell slot, but if the cannon is not used on the next round, it discharges harmlessly and must be charged again.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you use your action to cast an evocation spell into the charged arcane cannon, you can choose a ship as a target instead of a creature. The spell must have a duration of Instantaneous and a range of 5 feet or greater. The GM can decide if a spell is inappropriate to be magnified by the cannon.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The arcane cannon transforms the spell into a mega spell; as such, this spell fails if it is cast within an area of gravitation. Its range and the dimensions of its spell effects are multiplied by 100, to a maximum range of 10,000 feet. Also, the spell deals mega damage instead of normal damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a spell cast through the arcane cannon targeting a ship calls for a saving throw, the pilot makes that saving throw on behalf of the ship itself. Abilities like Evasion don't affect this type of saving throw.</p>\n<h3>Cloaking</h3>\n<p>The engineer must use their action to activate or deactivate this system, causing the ship to become invisible or to return to visibility. This invisibility ends if your ship attacks, takes damage, moves more than 500 feet on its turn, or if anyone aboard the ship casts a spell or uses a system (such as a teleporter) that penetrates the ship&rsquo;s hull. The ship can be invisible for a total of 5 minutes each day, though this time doesn't need to be used in consecutive turns. This time recharges 24 hours after use.</p>\n<h3>Communications</h3>\n<p>For two ships to communicate, they must both have a functioning communications system and be within 1,000<br />miles of one another. This system normally transmits only audio communication, and most systems also translate it to the listener&rsquo;s language, as per the tongues spell (though older models and those in disrepair are less likely to have<br />this feature).</p>\n<h3>Fabricator</h3>\n<p>Though most ships carry rations for long journeys, many employ a magic fabricator which replicates the effects of the create food and water spell to provide a reliable source of nourishment for the entire crew. Indeed, many view this type of system as being a part of life support itself.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some ships use even more sophisticated replicators, capable of not only creating food and drink, but also capable of manufacturing just about anything, as per the fabricate spell. Though these more sophisticated systems are phenomenally expensive, they&rsquo;re essential for the largest of ships, which contain innumerable parts which can fail at a moment&rsquo;s notice. Any ship of Corvette size or larger with this system can be expected to have the fabricate version of this system installed.</p>\n<h3>Hypercapacitor</h3>\n<p>A hypercapacitor is an immense secondary power cell, which slowly charges itself until it contains a staggering quantity of arcane energy. The engineer can discharge the hypercapacitor in place of supplying a spell slot of 5th<br />level or lower to power a void jump or overcharge the engine. Once discharged, it takes 24 hours to charge, but a spellcaster can use their action and expend a spell slot of the same level as the Dark Matter engine&rsquo;s class to charge<br />it early. A ship can have no more than two hypercapacitors installed at one time.</p>\n<h3>Life Pods</h3>\n<p>In the event of catastrophic ship failure, life pods are the last hope for survival. A ship with this system has a single-person life pod for each crew member and passenger. At any time, you can use your action to board a life pod and eject from the ship. The pod travels far enough to clear any explosion of the ship, then drifts aimlessly. The pod has extremely minimal thrusters&mdash;enough to change direction two or three times&mdash;and enough air, power, and rations to sustain its passenger for 7 days. Each life pod automatically produces a distress signal that can be detected by any ship with sensors, though such a signal only travels at the speed of light&mdash;very slow by galactic scale. A life pod can survive reentry on most planets.</p>\n<h3>Life Support</h3>\n<p>Providing a ship with air, heat, and artificial gravity, a life support system is the most integral part of a ship for its crew. If a life support system is disabled, a temporary life support system will typically be engaged, providing the ship with air and heat for up to an hour, but not restoring artificial gravity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For less conventional starships, such as those shaped as galleons or which are built within great trees, the life support system extends a bubble of heat and atmosphere around the entire ship.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is possible to survive for some time without a functioning life support system, as long as crew members have functioning life suits, but these alternatives are frequently a temporary stop-gap while the life support is repaired.<br />A crew member with sufficient privileges with the ship computer aboard the bridge of a ship can normally disable the life support manually as an action. Depending on the ship, this may allow them to vent atmosphere from the ship, disable the artificial gravity (rendering the entire ship a zero-gravity environment, if it&rsquo;s in space), disable the ship&rsquo;s heaters, or do all of those things to all or part of the ship.</p>\n<h3>Probe</h3>\n<p>This remotely piloted drone is deployed from the ship to analyze potentially hazardous environments ahead of the ship itself. The probe has no combat capabilities but transmits everything it sees and hears back to its controller. If the probe strays more than 100 miles from the controller, it loses connection and falls dormant until the controller unit is within signal range. The statistics for a probe are included in the Example Ships section.</p>\n<h3>Sensors</h3>\n<p>The vast majority of ships are equipped with an array of sensors used to pinpoint ships and other obstacles within 100 miles. If these sensors are missing or disabled, a ship can only see and make attacks within its cone of movement.</p>\n<h3>Shield Generator</h3>\n<p>A massive arcane projector, pulsing with waves of abjuration magic, a shield generator is required for a ship to have a directional shield. If it is disabled, a ship loses all of its shield points until it is repaired.</p>\n<h3>Shuttle</h3>\n<p>Like fighters, shuttles are smaller ships which can be deployed from a parent ship as an action to perform a number of operations. Whereas fighters are strictly offensive, however, shuttles aren't typically equipped with weapons, and can instead hold a more sizable crew and a larger capacity of cargo. Shuttles are usually used to ferry people and goods between the main ship and a planet&rsquo;s surface, and make for a cheap and effective alternative to teleportation. The statistics for a shuttle are included in the Example Ships section.</p>\n<h3>Sickbay</h3>\n<p>Illness and injury are bound to happen on a starship, and without a dedicated healer onboard, a sickbay is a critical facility on any starship. This system has a pool of 6 medical dice, which are d8s. Each of these dice recharge 24 hours after being used. You can spend 1 minute in a sickbay and expend one or more of these dice to cause you or another creature in the sickbay to regain hit points equal to the value rolled. Alternatively, you can expend 3 medical dice to cure yourself of any disease or poison afflicting you or another creature in the sickbay.</p>\n<h3>Simulator</h3>\n<p>Because voyages aboard a starship can last months or even years at a time, simulating the luxuries of home can be a great boon to the crew's morale. A simulator is an immensely complex room, technically a sentient magic item, that employs dozens of systems to create the effects of the spells hallucinatory terrain and major image to replicate entire environments and situations. Though this system was designed to train crew members for dangerous situations and to simulate tactical battles, it is just as often employed for entertainment purposes.</p>\n<h3>Teleporters</h3>\n<p>Blinking from the inside of a ship onto the surface of a planet is an invaluable function for many starships. As such, many ships contain a number of permanent teleportation circles specially designed for this type of short-range transportation. The ship&rsquo;s engineer can use their action to activate the teleportation system, targeting a single unmoving location within 100 miles of the ship and creating a temporary destination teleportation circle at that location. This circle lasts for 1 minute or until another teleportation circle is created. Because the resonance of a Dark Matter engine interferes with the teleportation magic, you can&rsquo;t create a destination circle inside a ship which has a functioning Dark Matter engine unless engineers on both ships coordinate the teleporters to allow transit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes, a network of teleportation circles will be set up inside particularly large ships to facilitate quick navigation. Such teleporters are constantly active.</p>\n<h3>Tractor Beam</h3>\n<p>A tractor beam is a very large device designed to pull spacecraft and other objects toward the ship. If you are in the Engineer role, you can use your action to make a ranged spell attack using a tractor beam. The target must be an object or ship within 3,000 feet that is less than half the size of your ship and isn't moving away from it. If you are not a spellcaster, you only add your proficiency bonus to this attack roll.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a hit, the target is caught in the tractor beam. At the beginning of each of your turns, you can use your action to maintain the beam and pull the target up to 500 feet closer to your ship. The target can&rsquo;t otherwise move while it is within the tractor beam.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the target is a ship, it can attempt to break free of the tractor beam. The pilot of the target ship can make a Dexterity (Piloting) check on its turn, opposed by your Intelligence (Technology) check. If you fail, the ship uses half its movement speed to escape the tractor beam and can move freely for the remainder of its movement.</p>\n<h3>Umbilicus</h3>\n<p>An umbilicus is a long, hollow cable which extends from one ship to another (a maximum of 100 feet), allowing the transport of people and goods between the two without&nbsp; compromising the hull of either ship. An umbilicus is required to board another ship.</p>\n<h2>Customizing Your Ship</h2>\n<p>As parts fail and repairs are made in the Black, most ships start to look less and less like their original factory models and more like customized Frankenstein ships, composed of parts from dozens of vessels, strapped to a vaguely familiar frame. Sometimes, these sorts of repairs are necessary to keep the ship operating, but other times, they&rsquo;re optional, made solely to upgrade the original model in desirable ways. There are four general varieties of customizations you can give a ship: upgrading a ship&rsquo;s Dark Matter engine, replacing weapons, adding new systems, and other general upgrades. You can install two or more upgrades at the same time, as long as you have access to a spaceport and enough people to install all the upgrades simultaneously.</p>\n<h3>Upgrading a Dark Matter Engine</h3>\n<p>Installing a new Dark Matter engine is no trivial task. The void crystals at the core of a Dark Matter engine are extremely fragile and must be in pristine condition to operate correctly. If an engine is installed incorrectly, the void crystals will likely be damaged, resulting in an immediate (or delayed) instability event, consuming the ship and all aboard it in a sphere of annihilation. Often, automatons will perform most of the testing after trained engineers have installed the crystals. Despite the risk and the cost, you can upgrade a ship&rsquo;s Dark Matter engine by 1 class (or install a Class 1 Dark Matter engine into a ship that didn&rsquo;t have one) with 7 days of work and a cost in materials and labor<br />as shown on the Dark Matter Upgrade table. Upgrading a Dark Matter engine on a ship larger than a frigate is generally impossible, as larger engines are too deeply interconnected to the ship to be replaced.</p>\n<table style=\"height: 105px; width: 228px;\" border=\"0\" width=\"236\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><colgroup><col style=\"width: 167px;\" width=\"115\" /> <col style=\"width: 257px;\" width=\"121\" /> </colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 15px;\">\n<td class=\"xl67\" style=\"height: 15px; width: 177pt;\" colspan=\"2\" width=\"236\" height=\"20\">\n<h2>Dark Matter Upgrade</h2>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15px;\">\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"height: 15px;\" height=\"20\"><em>Ship Size</em></td>\n<td class=\"xl65\" style=\"width: 91pt; height: 15px;\" width=\"121\"><em>Cost</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15px;\">\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"height: 15px;\" height=\"20\">Fighter</td>\n<td class=\"xl65\" style=\"width: 91pt; height: 15px;\" width=\"121\">2,500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15px;\">\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"height: 15px;\" height=\"20\">Personal</td>\n<td class=\"xl65\" style=\"width: 91pt; height: 15px;\" width=\"121\">5,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15px;\">\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"height: 15px;\" height=\"20\">Transport</td>\n<td class=\"xl65\" style=\"width: 91pt; height: 15px;\" width=\"121\">12,500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15px;\">\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"height: 15px;\" height=\"20\">Corvette</td>\n<td class=\"xl65\" style=\"width: 91pt; height: 15px;\" width=\"121\">25,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 15px;\">\n<td class=\"xl66\" style=\"height: 15px;\" height=\"20\">Frigate</td>\n<td class=\"xl65\" style=\"width: 91pt; height: 15px;\" width=\"121\">37,500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Upgrading Weapons</h3>\n<p>The ideal ship would have dozens of weapons installed on every external surface, covering every possible direction with extreme firepower. Reality, however, gets in the way. Because each weapon needs a gunner, each external weapon is linked to a single gunner station on the inside of the ship. Unfortunately, this means most ships can&rsquo;t install additional weapons&mdash;doing so would require a complete overhaul of the ship&rsquo;s internal layout.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is relatively simple, however, to replace one ship weapon with another. Doing so requires 1 day of work and the cost of the weapon to be installed. Removed weapons can be kept in storage (though most are massively heavy and spacious) or sold at half market value.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can also change the mounting location of a facing weapon with 8 hours of work, choosing for the weapon to be installed facing the front, back, left, or right of the ship.</p>\n<h3>Adding New Systems</h3>\n<p>Ships have a wide variety of systems at their disposal, expanding their capabilities and comforts, making them both powerful weapons and cozy homes. Ships have room to install three additional systems before space on board becomes a significant problem. However, fightersized ships have much tighter space, and have no room for additional systems. After the maximum number of systems are installed, new systems can only be installed by removing other systems from the ship.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Installing a shield generator on a ship that doesn't have one gives that ship 8 shield points.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can install a new system with 7 days of work and a cost in materials and labor as shown on the System Costs table.</p>\n<h3>Other Upgrades</h3>\n<p>Starships can be outfitted with an array of upgrades that aren&rsquo;t as modular as replacing a weapon or adding a newsystem. Each of the following upgrades can be installed on a ship once, unless otherwise specified. You can install a new system with 7 days of work and a cost in materials and labor as shown in the Ship Upgrades table.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"width: 306px;\" border=\"0\" width=\"285\"

in alphabetical order.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Afterburners</strong></em>. Your ship&rsquo;s movement speed increases by 500 feet if the pilot moves it in a straight line.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>AI Core</strong></em>. Your ship's computer has an installed construct core that manifests a sentient shipboard artificial intelligence. This AI serves to keep the ship in running order and has some interaction with all of the ship's systems, allowing it to see and hear every part of the ship and control all of its systems. It can communicate with the ship's passengers via the ship's computer system and any built-in intercom systems on the ship.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The AI has an Intelligence of 17, a Charisma of 14, and a Wisdom of 13. It is proficient in Technology (+5) and Data (+5). It can make Intelligence checks when any situation arises and will inform its passengers of any information it knows.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, at a crew member's command, the AI can directly assume any character role aboard the ship. The AI can perform any action provided by that role, taking its turn at the end of the initiative order. The ship adds +3 to all of its attack rolls.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AI personalities can vary wildly. Some are snarky and occasionally play jokes on their crew, while others are fiercely logical and derive pleasure chiefly from calculating probabilities to dozens of decimal places. All, however, generally enjoy their hulls and decks being cleaned regularly.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Antivirus Module</strong></em>. Your ship has a secondary arcane terminal which screens all access to the ship computer for hacking attempts. Any attempt to hack the ship&rsquo;s computer or any system or door control has disadvantage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Arcana-Resistant Coating</strong></em>. Any crew member that must make a saving throw to resist a magic effect originating from outside the ship can add +2 to the roll.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Assault Port</strong></em>. Dogfighters can deploy from your ship as a bonus action, rather than an action.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ship must have the Dogfighter role to accept this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Captain&rsquo;s Chair</strong></em>. Your ship comes equipped with a luxurious command chair, laden with communication controls and a single prominent red button. The captain can take one of their special actions as a bonus action, and regains the ability to do so after 24 hours. The captain can&rsquo;t take the same special action twice on the same turn.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ship must have the Captain role to accept this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Countermeasures</strong></em>. Your ship has a series of flares or a deployable decoy designed to confuse the targeting of a pursuing vessel. You can trigger your countermeasures as a reaction when you are targeted by an attack, causing that attack to have disadvantage. Once you use your countermeasures, you must load a new set in a process which takes 1 minute.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ship must be fighter-sized to accept this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Cruising Engines</strong></em>. Your ship&rsquo;s sublight speed is doubled.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Ded Reckoner</strong></em>. Your ship has a complex flight computer, which attempts to calculate a course through the Void. When you make a blind void jump, you can add +5 to the roll.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ship must have a Dark Matter engine to accept this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Detonation Failsafe</strong></em>. Your ship is less likely to suffer catastrophic failure and has advantage on detonation saving throws.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Expanded Hold</strong></em>. Your ship&rsquo;s cargo capacity increases by 50%.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Expanded Quarters</strong></em>. Your ship can hold 25% more passengers (rounded up) above its normal capacity without overly taxing the life support during long voyages.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>External Manipulators</strong></em>. A pair of extensible clawed arms can fold out from the hull of your ship or fold down again as an action. These arms can reach up 50 feet and can each push, pull, or grip with a maximum force of 1,000 pounds.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Internal Reinforcements</strong></em>. You have improved the integrity of your fighter by filling every hollow space with lightweight reinforcements. Your fighter&rsquo;s mega hit points increases by 10.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ship must be fighter-sized to accept this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Jump Rift</strong></em>. When your ship makes a void jump, any ship within 500 feet of it is carried with it when it jumps.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ship must have a Dark Matter engine to accept this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Lifeform Scanner</strong></em>. You enhance your ship&rsquo;s sensors to be able to detect living creatures. The ship&rsquo;s engineer can spend 1 minute to scan a ship within 100 miles to determine the exact number of living humanoids onboard.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ship must have sensors to accept this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Live Feed</strong></em>. Your communications system provides a live video feed or holographic image of both parties. The recipient can choose whether or not to mask their image from your feed. Both parties must have a live feed to use this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ship must have communications to accept this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Material Analyzer</strong></em>. Your sensors have been upgraded with a directional scanner that determines a target's composition. The ship&rsquo;s engineer can spend 1 minute to scan a target within 1,000 miles, learning by percent which metals, minerals, and materials make up the target.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ship must have sensors to accept this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Medical Station</strong></em>. A complete overhaul of your ship's sickbay has made it analogous to a small hospital. Your sickbay has twice as many (12) medical dice. Additionally, you can spend 1 minute and expend 3 medical dice to remove a level of exhaustion from yourself or another creature in the sickbay, or to end one of the following conditions afflicting you or another creature in the sickbay: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ship must have a sickbay to accept this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Overshield</strong></em>. An additional generator is added to supplement the shields, increasing your ship&rsquo;s maximum<br />shield points by 6.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ship must have a shield generator to accept this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Panic Drive</strong></em>. Your ship&rsquo;s Dark Matter engine has been heavily customized with a secondary arcane engine to pump energy into the core for faster, but more erratic charging times. Once the engineer has taken the Void Jump action to charge the Dark Matter engine, they can use their action on each of their subsequent turns to panic jump the Dark Matter drive, possibly jumping early. Roll a d6. On a 5 or 6, the ship jumps early.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ship must have a Dark Matter engine to accept this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Radio Array</strong></em>. Your ship can communicate with another ship out to a range of 10,000 miles, rather than 1,000 miles. If the receiving ship has communications but does not have this upgrade, it can receive messages, but not transmit replies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ship must have communications to receive this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Reinforced Hull</strong></em>. Great alloyed bands are attached on the exterior of the hull, increasing your ship&rsquo;s AC by 1.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Repair Drones</strong></em>. A series of mechanized drones patrol the outer side of the hull, automatically sealing leaks and repairing structural damage. If your ship is below half its hit point maximum, it regains 1 mega hit point at the beginning of the initiative order.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Targeting Optics</strong></em>. One installed ship weapon of your choice gains a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls and its range increases by 500 feet. You can choose this upgrade more than once, applying it to a different weapon each time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Tri-Probe</strong></em>. Instead of holding only one drone, your probe bay instead holds three. Each of these probes can be controlled independently.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ship must have a probe to receive this upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Smuggler&rsquo;s Hold</strong></em>. Your ship has hidden compartments in its hold, perfect for smuggling. These compartments can hold up to 1,000 pounds (which don't count against your ship&rsquo;s cargo capacity) in objects no larger than 6 feet in any dimension.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/ship-pg157.png"}

Suddenly, a spark of blue electricity flashes across the room and scorches the far wall. The gnome grins and puts away his tools.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;An amoeboid carefully positions a rabbit on a pedestal, stands back, and presses a large red button. With a pop and a puff of fur, the rabbit vanishes, only to hop back into the room seconds later, hairless from the waist down. The amoeboid nods and scratches down a few notes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;A bald human woman with a glowing, red, robotic eye tightens the joints on her new cybernetic arm. Her work complete, she rears back her metal fist and crushes a nearby chair.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Gadgeteers are masters of technology and engineering, turning every device available to their advantage. Assisted by their artificial intelligence companions, gadgeteers pursue the cutting edge of science and innovation, acquiring a mass of gadgets and a wealth of knowledge along the way.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Cutting-Edge Innovators</h2>\n<div><img style=\"float: left;\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/classes/gadgeteer-full-alp.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"256\" height=\"211\" /></div>\n<p>Impelled by the lure of systems and logic, a wildly eccentric group embraces the sciences. These disparate tinkers, students, and inventors tend to be uniformly welleducated (or at least highly self-educated) in the principles of science, arcana, and engineering, with a particular focus on practical applications. Though most gadgeteers are at least curious about the underlying mysteries of the universe, many view groundbreaking scientific discoveries as a means to an end; theory only exists to facilitate application.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Fueled by breakthroughs and scientific advances, gadgeteers push the cutting edge of science and innovation, devising new technological marvels (or at least new blaster variants) at a breakneck pace. Some gadgeteers become absorbed in a particular problem, innovating and optimizing solutions for it alone, while others devise technological marvels wherever they can find application. All the great advances of the modern world, from datapads to Dark Matter engines, have been spearheaded by gadgeteers.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>AIs</h2>\n<p>A gadgeteer is rarely seen far from the floating holographic orb that is their Artificial Intelligence (AI) companion. After all, an organic brain can only hold so much information, whereas an AI can recall equations, trace schematics, and perform calculations with ease. Such intellect is nothing without a gadgeteer's ingenuity, of course, but the watchful eye of an AI can still spot errors that their creator might not have noticed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;But more than that, an AI companion is also a tireless friend. The endless work of a gadgeteer can often be monotonous and isolating, but the constant, friendly voice of an AI in one's ear goes a long way to preventing mad scientists and doomsday devices.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Creating a Gadgeteer</h2>\n<p>When devising your gadgeteer, consider what draws your character to the sciences. Is it the challenge of working out a new puzzle, or the thrill of perfecting a new invention? Perhaps your character is obsessed with a particular facet of the universe, and longs to unravel its mysteries. Think about how you learned about science and engineering. Did you have a mentor that shaped your understanding, or are you totally self-educated?</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, consider which Prototype you&rsquo;ll pick when you reach 2nd level. Are you interested in having a gadget for every situation, or do you just prefer having a big, hulking mech suit? Consider what this prototype means for your specialization and your character&rsquo;s personality in general. Lastly, put some thought into your AI. What&rsquo;s its name, and what type of personality does it possess, if any?</p>\n<h3>Quick Build</h3>\n<p>Follow these suggestions to quickly build a gadgeteer. Choose Intelligence as your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. Investing in Constitution might also be wise for characters that intend to select the Experimental Frame Prototype at 2nd level. For your equipment, choose a researcher&rsquo;s pack and an antimatter dagger. Lastly, choose the Technologist background.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>Class Features</h1>\n<p>As a gadgeteer, you gain the following class features:</p>\n<h3>Hit Points</h3>\n<p><strong>Hit Dice</strong>: 1d6 per gadgeteer level</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level</strong>: 6 + your Constitution modifier</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels</strong>: 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per gadgeteer level after 1st</p>\n<h3>Proficiencies</h3>\n<p><strong>Armor</strong>: Light armor</p>\n<p><strong>Weapons</strong>: Simple and martial blasters, simple weapons</p>\n<p><strong>Tools</strong>: Alchemist&rsquo;s supplies, circuitry kit, mechanist&rsquo;s tools, ship maintenance tools, smith&rsquo;s tools, tinker tools</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throws</strong>: Intelligence, Dexterity</p>\n<p><strong>Skills</strong>: Choose three from Arcana, Data, Deception, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Piloting, Religion, Sleight of Hand, or Technology</p>\n<h3>Equipment</h3>\n<p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A repeater and any simple weapon</li>\n<li>(a) a martial blaster or (b) two simple blasters</li>\n<li>(a) a circuitry kit or (b) a mechanist&rsquo;s tools</li>\n<li>An engineer&rsquo;s pack and leather armor</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>AI Companion</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 1st level, you are assisted by an AI companion, an intricate data construct which lives on your datapad and possesses near human-like levels of intelligence. When it manifests, it does so as a simple geometric projection; otherwise, it is merely a voice in your ear, checking your reasoning and informing you of relevant information. Your companion can solve any arithmetic or strictly logical problem you pose to it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Additionally, whenever you make an Intelligence (Technology) check, you can treat the result as 10, or your gadgeteer level + your Intelligence modifier, whichever is higher.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Your AI companion downloads and integrates knowledge of additional subjects as you gain higher levels in this class. At 6th level, and again at 10th level and 15th level, you can choose one of the following skills to gain this benefit when you make an Intelligence check with it: Arcana, Data, History, Investigation, Nature, or Religion.</p>\n<h2>Gadgets</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you begin to amass a collection of cutting-edge technological devices called gadgets. You gain one gadget of your choice for which you meet the prerequisites. Because your gadgets are powered by your personal power cell, no other creature can use them. If one of your gadgets is lost or damaged, you can fashion a new one for no cost when you take a long rest.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;You acquire additional gadgets as you gain levels in this class, as shown on the Gadgeteer table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the gadgets you have and replace it with another one that you could gain at that level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Your gadget options are detailed at the end of the class description.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Saving Throws</em>. If one of your gadgets calls for a saving throw, its DC is calculated as follows:</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Gadget save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<h2>Overcharge</h2>\n<p>With your technical aptitude and ingenuity, you can modify blasters to fire in more intense bursts. Starting at 2nd level, once on each of your turns when you hit a target with an attack from a blaster, you can deal an additional die of damage to that target.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;This ability improves as you gain levels in this class. You add an additional die of damage at 5th level (2 dice), 11th level (3 dice), and 17th level (4 dice). Additionally, starting at 11th level, when you use this ability, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the blaster&rsquo;s damage roll.</p>\n<h2>Prototype</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, you make a breakthrough innovation with a prototype of your own design. Choose one of the following three prototypes.</p>\n<h3>Experimental Frame</h3>\n<p>You have developed a sophisticated experimental frame, a powerful exo-suit that augments your strength and shelters you from harm. Your experimental frame counts as heavy armor, which you can don or doff as a bonus action, and it also grants you the benefits of a life suit. You are proficient with your experimental frame, but no other creature can wear it. While wearing your frame, you gain the following benefits:</p>\n<p>&bull; Your size becomes Medium, if it is smaller.</p>\n<p>&bull; Your movement speed increases to 30 feet, if it is less.</p>\n<p>&bull; Your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Intelligence modifier. This armor can't be enchanted or modified to improve its Armor Class.</p>\n<p>&bull; Whenever you begin your turn wearing this frame, you gain temporary hit points equal to your gadgeteer level. These hit points last until you remove the frame.</p>\n<p>&bull; You can integrate a simple or martial weapon directly into your frame, or you can integrate two weapons (one into each arm) if neither has the Two-Handed property. When you draw an integrated weapon, it snaps to your hand and you can&rsquo;t be disarmed of it. Your frame is programmed in all manner of combat protocol, so you can use these integrated weapons proficiently while wearing your frame, even if you're not normally proficient in their use. You can switch which weapons are integrated when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>&bull; When you make an attack with an integrated melee weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of your Strength or Dexterity, for attack and damage rolls.</p>\n<p>&bull; Starting at 5th level, when you make a melee weapon attack with an integrated weapon, you can make an additional melee attack using that weapon as a bonus action.</p>\n<h3>@Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.monsters.gcv0riOmF3lR0gvw]{Mechanized Autonomous Construct}</h3>\n<p>You have put the finishing touches on a Mechanized Autonomous Construct (a MAC), which is a speciallyconstructed automaton piloted by your AI.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The construct has statistics as shown above, and takes its own turn in combat immediately after yours. On your turn, you can mentally command your construct if it is within 500 feet of you (no action required). You decide what action it will take and where it will move during its turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. In combat, your construct's actions are governed by its Combat Protocols, which you can switch as a bonus action on your turn. If you are incapacitated or absent, your AI guides your construct to protect you and itself.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; If your construct drops to 0 hit points, it becomes disabled. When you take a long rest, you can repair your construct to its full hit points. You are always considered to have enough materials to build and repair your construct.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; You can integrate weapons and gadgets directly into your construct. You can integrate one two-handed melee weapon, two one-handed melee weapons, or a one-handed melee weapon and a gadget. When your construct draws an integrated weapon or gadget, the item snaps to its hand and it can&rsquo;t be disarmed of it. Your construct is proficient with any weapons integrated into it. The construct takes the Use an Object action to activate an integrated gadget.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Starting at 5th level, your construct makes two attacks, instead of one, when you command it to take the Attack action with its integrated weapons.</p>\n<h3>Utility Matrix</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; You have developed a utility matrix, an advanced, cubeshaped mechanism that rearranges its form and function into that of other devices. Your matrix can become any of the following gadgets, which you can use at will:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Cloaking Device</strong></em>. As an action, you can activate your cloaking device to temporarily warp the light around you and hide yourself from view. You become invisible until the beginning of your next turn, or until you make an attack, cast a spell, or use a gadget. Once you use this gadget, you can't use it again on the following round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Flashbang</strong></em>. As a bonus action, you throw a concussive bomb at your feet, disorienting and distracting nearby foes. Each creature within 5 feet of you can't take reactions until the start of its next turn. Once you use this gadget, you can't use it again on the following round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Forcefield Projector</strong></em>. As a bonus action, you can activate your forcefield projector, temporarily sheltering yourself behind a powerful electromagnetic field. Until the beginning of your next turn, your Armor Class increases by your Intelligence modifier. Once you use this gadget, you can't use it again on the following round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Grappling Hook</strong></em>. As a reaction when you fall, or as a bonus action on your turn, you can project a grappling hook at a target location you can see within your movement speed. If the target location can hold your weight, you are pulled there, expending movement normally. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. Once you use this gadget, you can't use it again on the following round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Modular Gadget</strong></em>. Starting at 5th level, you can reconfigure your utility matrix into an un-upgraded gadget of your choice that does not have prerequisites. This gadget doesn't count against your total number of gadgets known. Alternately, you can reconfigure your utility matrix into an upgrade for an existing gadget for which you meet prerequisites. Once you reconfigure your utility matrix, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2>Tech Specialty</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 3rd level, you adopt a tech specialty that informs your gadgeteering expertise. Choose one Tech Specialty option. Your selection grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>\n<h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can&rsquo;t increase an ability score<br />above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<h2>Bluescreen Protocol</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 7th level, you have integrated a complex construct-disabling algorithm into your AI companion, which you can activate as an action. Each construct within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw with disadvantage against your Gadget save DC. On a failed save, a construct is incapacitated and its speed is reduced<br />to 0 until the beginning of your next turn, even if it would otherwise be immune to being incapacitated.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h2>Override Protocol</h2>\n<p>At 18th level, your AI companion can upload a devastating virus to seize control of a construct. You can use your action to touch a construct within your reach, which must succeed a Wisdom saving throw against your Gadget save DC or be charmed by you for 1 hour, even if it would otherwise be immune to being charmed. While it is charmed, you can issue commands to the construct while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as attack that creature, run over there, or fetch that object. If the construct completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2>Antimagic Pulse</h2>\n<p>By 20th level, you perfect a cutting-edge device capable of producing an antimagic pulse (abbreviated AMP), a type of energetic burst that completely disrupts and disables magic and machines. You can use your action to throw this device to a location within 60 feet, which explodes in a flash of blue light. This device creates an antimagic field (as per the spell) for 1 minute centered on the device, with the following changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The effect is a 20-foot radius sphere.</li>\n<li>Magical technology (including your gadgets and blasters) count as magic items and are suppressed within the sphere. Blasters can&rsquo;t be used to make attacks while within the sphere, and attacks with them can&rsquo;t penetrate into it.</li>\n<li>Constructs within the sphere are paralyzed for the duration, even if they would otherwise be immune to this condition.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Destroying the device once it is thrown doesn't end its effects early. Once you use this device, it fizzles out. You can make a new one when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h1>Tech Specialties</h1>\n<p>Gadgeteers tend to be well-read on a variety of subjects, from data structures and artificial intelligence to blaster mechanics and engineering, but typically put their finest efforts into a pet project of some sort. While working on other tasks, the details of their pet project are running in the background of their minds, slowly being solved and pieced together, while other work busies their hands.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With enough experience, the subjects of a gadgeteer&rsquo;s hobby become their tech specialty, a topic in which they are as expert as they are captivated. Often, this specialty is coupled with an objective, a goal to be engineered. Gadgeteers will travel great distances to share research on their mutual specialties, exchanging breakthroughs and discoveries in an effort to achieve a common goal.</p>\n<h2>Drone Jockey</h2>\n<p>Most gadgeteers tinker with drones at some point in their career; after all, they&rsquo;re compact, useful projects, with a limited number of moving parts. However, only drone jockeys take this to the extreme of arming themselves with a small army of programmed drones. By linking the drones&rsquo; sensors and construct cores, they create a more cunning swarm intelligence, distributed over the drone network as a whole. This swarm can act almost autonomously, scouting the area and defending the jockey with mechanical efficiency.</p>\n<h3>Hivemaster</h3>\n<p>Starting when you choose this specialty, you gain a special drone controller magic item and a pair of drones. These drones can be any two of the following three: a defense drone, a medical drone, or a recon drone (see Monsters chapter for statistics). Your drone controller is linked to both drones and you can use your bonus action to command all of your drones at once.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your drones are improved in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can add your level to the HP of your drones.</li>\n<li>When one of your drones makes an attack, its attack bonus equals your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.</li>\n<li>When your medical drone heals a creature, it restores 1d10 hit points.</li>\n<li>Your recon drone marks three creatures it can see, instead of only one.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You gain an additional drone of your choice at 6th level (3 drones), 10th level (4 drones), and 14th level (5 drones).</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your <em>drone controller</em> can only command three drones at a time, and only two of those drones can be the same type, but you can deploy a stored drone as an action if one becomes disabled. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can retrofit one of your drones, changing it into a different type.</p>\n<h3>Sacrificial Dive</h3>\n<p>At 6th level, when you are targeted by a ranged attack, you can use your reaction to command one of your drones within 5 feet of you to fly in the way of the attack. This attack targets the drone instead.</p>\n<h3>Focus Fire</h3>\n<p>Beginning at 10th level, your AI companion takes direct control of your drones, aiming and firing them as you direct. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can command your drones without using a bonus action.</p>\n<h3>Omega Drone</h3>\n<p>At 14th level, as an action, you can combine three of your drones (a defense drone, a medical drone, and a recon drone) into a single omega drone. Once combined, the omega drone&rsquo;s AC equals 10 + your Intelligence modifier, its HP equals 5 times your level, and its ability scores are all 14.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The drone can take all the actions of its constituent drones and takes its own turn immediately after yours in initiative, acting as directed by your AI. On a hit with its integrated blaster, it deals 3d6 radiant damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your <em>drone controller</em> can't link to other drones while your omega drone is active. You can separate your omega drone back into its constituent drones as an action.</p>\n<h2>Futurist</h2>\n<p>As a futurist, you believe that artificial intelligence is the zenith of all invention. To engineer a perfect AI, one which is capable of inventing on its own merits, is to conquer limitless problems by proxy. After all, an advanced AI which doesn't degrade into a rogue intelligence could turn its vastly superior intellect to dramatically improving the world, innovating in ways organic minds couldn't imagine. Your experiments with neural networks and intelligence theory have steadily edged you closer to finding such an AI, and granted your AI companion newfound aptitude along the way.</p>\n<h3>Advanced Subroutines</h3>\n<p>Starting when you choose this specialty at 3rd level, your AI takes a more active role in assisting you, rather than merely chirping up from time to time. Your AI can run any of the following subroutines, and you can command it to switch between subroutines as a bonus action.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Genetic Algorithm</em>. When you take damage from a hostile creature, subtract 1 from the damage dealt. Each additional time you take damage while this subroutine is running, the amount you subtract from the damage dealt increases by 1, up to a maximum of your Intelligence modifier. This amount resets to 1 after 1 minute or when you switch subroutines.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Heatmap</em>. When you have advantage on a weapon attack, you can add your proficiency bonus to the damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Neural Network</em>. When you use the Attack action to attack a hostile creature and miss, you gain a cumulative +1 bonus to subsequent attack rolls you make while this subroutine is running, up to a maximum of your Intelligence modifier. You don't increase this bonus if you attempt to attack a creature that you can't see or a creature that can't be hit. This amount resets to 0 after 1 minute or when you switch subroutines.</p>\n<h3>Novel Intelligence</h3>\n<p>At 3rd level, you have vastly improved your AI's intellect. Your AI Companion feature applies its benefit to another Intelligence skill of your choice. Additionally, your AI knows all languages and can perfectly recall everything it has seen and heard within the last 30 days.</p>\n<h3>Tactical Analysis</h3>\n<p>Starting at 6th level, as a bonus action, you can command your AI to perform a full evaluation of your strategic options and advise you of likely scenarios. Until the beginning of your next turn, you have advantage on the next attack roll you make, and the next attack roll made against you has disadvantage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Recursive Deterrence</h3>\n<p>By 10th level, your AI has implemented passive routines that scan for incoming blaster fire and ready you for counterattack. As a reaction when a creature within 15 feet of you makes a ranged weapon attack, you can use your reaction to make a ranged weapon attack targeting that creature.</p>\n<h3>Singularity</h3>\n<p>Beginning at 14th level, your AI is nearly prescient. As a bonus action, you can allow your AI to override your very movements, guiding your shots to where targets will be. For the next minute, whenever you make a ranged attack roll and don't have disadvantage, you can treat the result as being equal to your gadgeteer level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Hardlight Architect</h3>\n<p>Hardlight might well be the penultimate arcane discovery. It is a strong yet malleable material, conjured fully-shaped from energy alone, and it can be used to construct entire functional systems in a flash. Through hardlight, engineers and arcanists can spontaneously prototype new designs in real space and replicate these designs later. Hardlight architects recognize the monumental importance of this material and dedicate their ambition and creativity to mastering it. As you perfect all the established hardlight spells, you constantly dream up new, innovative uses for the material, awaiting the day you can conjure a towering suit of hardlight power armor to crush your enemies and intimidate your rivals.</p>\n<h3>Hardlight Projector</h3>\n<p>When you choose this specialty at 3rd level, you construct a hardlight projector, a device capable of forming hardlight and shaping it to your whims. If the projector is lost or destroyed, you can construct a new one over a long rest for 200 gp. By using this device as an action, you can create a simple geometrical object of shimmering hardlight which must fit within a 1-foot cube. Whatever its shape, the object weighs 1 pound, lasts for 1 minute, has AC 10, and has 5 hit points.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Additionally, you can use the projector to cast the @Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.spells.CsNvRRgV7yDrKnZ6]{hardlight needle} cantrip.</p>\n<h3>Hardlight Spellcasting</h3>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, you can use your hardlight projector to emulate the actions of a spellcaster, enabling you to create more substantial hardlight spells. Your spell save DC for these spells equals your Gadget save DC and your spell attack bonus equals your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You can cast the spells hardlight blaster and hardlight nails once each and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Additionally, at 6th level, you can cast the spells hardlight construction and hardlight gauntlet once each. At 14th level, you can cast the spell hardlight frame once. You regain the ability to cast each of these spells when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Lightforge</h3>\n<p>Starting at 6th level, as a bonus action, you can forge a shield, a set of artisan tools, or any melee weapon that deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, entirely out of scintillating hardlight. After 10 minutes, this object evaporates completely into light.</p>\n<h3>Prototype Luxcannon</h3>\n<p>By 10th level, you&rsquo;ve perfected a stable hardlight weapon, which you can conjure effortlessly. You can cast the spell hardlight blaster at will and can apply your Overcharge feature to the spell.</p>\n<h3>Transient Avatar</h3>\n<p>At 14th level, you can cast the spell conjure hardlight avatar without using a spell slot or spell components as a bonus action. The spell's duration is until the end of your next turn. Once you cast this spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2>Mastermaker</h2>\n<p><img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"worlds/dm-start/images/items/classes/avia-ra-gadgeteer.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"198\" />Nearly all gadgeteers strive for perfection in their work, but mastermakers take this to a logical extreme: using the technology at their disposal, they seek to engineer away their own biological defects. By grafting gadgets and technology onto their bodies (and making liberal use of vect components), mastermakers gradually become hybrids of humanoids and machines. They are stronger, tougher, and more agile than their counterparts, but many would argue that their techniques are too extreme&mdash;too unnatural&mdash;no matter what the results.</p>\n<h3>Thermalsight</h3>\n<p>Starting when you choose this specialty at 3rd level, you have installed a vect optical sensor in place of one of your eyes, granting you thermalsight. You can see living creatures through darkness and heavily obscured conditions, such as fog, out to a range of 30 feet. You can also determine if a creature is living or dead though its body heat. However, you can't discern color, nor use this sense to see through illusions, invisibility, or magical darkness. This sense is blocked by one inch of any solid barrier. If you already had thermalsight, its range increases by 30 feet.</p>\n<h3>Embedded Gadgets</h3>\n<p>At 3rd level, you can install one gadget or a one-handed blaster directly into one of your arms. You can&rsquo;t be disarmed of this item and you can use it if at least one of your hands is free. Additionally, you can perfectly conceal this item, so long as another creature does not inspect the metal plates installed in your arm. You can change which gadget or blaster you have embedded when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Additionally, you don&rsquo;t lose hit points or hit dice from installing or removing construct grafts, and it takes you no time to recover after the attachment of a new graft.</p>\n<h3>Carbon Fiber Skin</h3>\n<p>At 6th level, you have installed a durable metallic mesh under much of your skin, and metallic plates to protect your organs. Your Armor Class increases by 1.</p>\n<h3>Reconfigure</h3>\n<p>By 10th level, enough of your body is mechanical that you can reconfigure your parts to improve your agility, might, or even intellect. One ability score of your choice increases by 2 and you can change this selection whenever you finish a long rest. You can't increase Constitution using this trait and you can't increase any ability score above 20.</p>\n<h3>Construct Perfection</h3>\n<p>By 14th level, you have achieved the height of construct superiority by installing a construct core directly into your head. You no longer need to sleep and magic can&rsquo;t put you to sleep. You are immune to being charmed, frightened, or possessed. Additionally, the maximum for your Intelligence score is now 22.</p>\n<h2>Nanoengineer</h2>\n<p>While other gadgeteers tinker with machines that fit in the palm of your hand, your machinations are smaller and your ambitions grander. As a nanoengineer, you work with nanomachines, unfathomably tiny robots capable of massive feats, from stitching together wounds at the microscopic level, to forming extraordinarily resilient materials. Your machines might appear as nothing more than a small blob of gray ooze, but once set to work, their effects are unmistakable.</p>\n<h3>Cutting-Edge Nanobots</h3>\n<p>Beginning when you choose this specialty at 3rd level, you have assembled a fabricator which generates a steady stream of advanced nanobots, called nanites. Your supply of nanites is represented by a pool of Nano points equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your gadgeteer level, rounded down. You can expend Nano points to employ your nanobots in varying ways, described below, and you regain all expended Nano points when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Deconstruct</em>. As an action, you well up a mass of nanites in your hand and fling them at a target within 15 feet of you. Spend any number of Nano points and make a ranged attack roll if the target is out of your reach; you automatically hit if the target is within your reach. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 necrotic damage per Nano point expended as the nanites unravel it at a cellular level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Nano-Hack</em>. You can expend up to 3 Nano points when you make an Intelligence (Data) check to hack a piece of technology, inserting your nanites into the machine. You can add 1d4 to the roll for each Nano point expended.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Reconstruct</em>. As an action, you can expend any number of Nano points to create a thin stream of nanites to repair damage and mend wounds of a willing target within 15 feet of you. The target regains 1d6 hit points per Nano point expended.</p>\n<h3>Nano-Duplicate</h3>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, as a bonus action, you can use your nanites to duplicate the exact shape, but not color or texture, of an object you touch that can fit within a 1-foot cube. The replica is made of nanites and lasts for 10 minutes.</p>\n<h3>Recycling Protocol</h3>\n<p>Starting at 6th level, you've programmed your nanites to repurpose material and multiply. When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points using a melee weapon attack or your Deconstruct ability, you regain 2 expended Nano points.</p>\n<h3>Nanite Weave</h3>\n<p>Starting at 10th level, you can use your action and spend up to 3 Nano points to stitch your nanites together in a protective mesh above your skin. These Nano points are invested in the mesh; you can have up to 3 points invested at once. While you aren't wielding a shield, you gain a bonus to your Armor Class equal to the number of Nano points invested. Whenever you take damage, nanites in the mesh are destroyed and you lose 1 invested point.</p>\n<h3>Network Response</h3>\n<p>Starting at 14th level, you can use your reaction when you take damage to use your Deconstruct ability, targeting the attacker, or Reconstruct ability, targeting yourself, spending up to 3 Nano points on either ability.</p>\n<h1>Gadgets</h1>\n<p><img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"worlds/dm-start/images/items/classes/death-ray-a.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"212\" /></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Your 'death ray' is just a blaster which kills people? I have an axe that kills people. Does that make it a 'death axe'?\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;- Throg, half-orc barbarian who asks really good questions</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If a gadget or an upgrade has prerequisites, you must meet them to gain it. You can gain a gadget or upgrade at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your gadgets count as magical technology. You must have a gadget before you can select its upgrade. If a gadget calls for a spell or magic item which requires a saving throw, its uses your Gadget save DC.</p>\n<h3>Adaptable Omnitool</h3>\n<p>This gadget can be configured into a number of useful devices, including the following:</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Auto-Entry Device</em>. This device automatically attempts to crack physical locks or hack powered doors when set to do so as an action. Its ability check for doing so is 10 + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Rebreather</em>. You can start or stop breathing through this apparatus as a bonus action. When doing so, you can breathe normally in airless environments. This device also shelters you from toxic fumes and other airborne poisons. You can't talk while breathing through this device.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Scanner</em>. As an action, you can use your handheld scanner to analyze the electromagnetic spectrum around you. Your scanner detects the presence, number, and type of technological devices within 30 feet of you and can determine whether or not a unique construct or device has been present in the area within the last hour.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Taser</em>. This device produces a debilitating current of electricity when you use it as an action. Make a melee attack roll (attack bonus equals your Intelligence bonus + your proficiency modifier) against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 lightning damage, and it can't take reactions until the start of its next turn. This damage increases to 2d8 lightning damage at when you reach 5th level, 3d8 at 11th level, and 4d8 at 17th level.</p>\n<h3>Blink Button</h3>\n<p>This complicated looking device has a single large red button on its face. When you press it as an action, you teleport up to 15 feet to an unoccupied location of your choice that you can see.</p>\n<h3>Bubble Projector</h3>\n<p>You construct a device that, as an action, creates a dome of force as if you had cast the spell geodesic shield. You don't need to concentrate on this spell. Once you use this gadget, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Chronoshifter</h3>\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 17th level</em></p>\n<p>When you use your bonus action to activate this sophisticated, spherical device, you temporarily distort time, as per the spell time stop. Once you use this gadget, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Death Ray</h3>\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 17th level</em></p>\n<p>You construct a death ray magic item.</p>\n<h3>F-MAC</h3>\n<p><em>Prerequisites: Mechanized Autonomous Construct prototype, 5th level</em></p>\n<p>You integrate a set of thrusters into your construct, granting it a flying speed of 30 feet.</p>\n<h3>Feedback Electrodes</h3>\n<p><em>Prerequisites: Utility Matrix Prototype, 5th level</em></p>\n<p>You&rsquo;ve installed an electrical feedback system into your Utility Matrix. When you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to deal 2d6 lightning damage to that creature.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This damage improves as you gain higher levels in this class. At 11th level, you can deal 3d6 damage, and at 17th level, you can deal 4d6 damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","img":"worlds/dm-start/images/items/classes/avia-ra-gadgeteer.png"}

Suddenly, a spark of blue electricity flashes across the room and scorches the far wall. The gnome grins and puts away his tools.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;An amoeboid carefully positions a rabbit on a pedestal, stands back, and presses a large red button. With a pop and a puff of fur, the rabbit vanishes, only to hop back into the room seconds later, hairless from the waist down. The amoeboid nods and scratches down a few notes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;A bald human woman with a glowing, red, robotic eye tightens the joints on her new cybernetic arm. Her work complete, she rears back her metal fist and crushes a nearby chair.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Gadgeteers are masters of technology and engineering, turning every device available to their advantage. Assisted by their artificial intelligence companions, gadgeteers pursue the cutting edge of science and innovation, acquiring a mass of gadgets and a wealth of knowledge along the way.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Cutting-Edge Innovators</h2>\n<div><img style=\"float: left;\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/classes/gadgeteer-full-alp.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"256\" height=\"211\" /></div>\n<p>Impelled by the lure of systems and logic, a wildly eccentric group embraces the sciences. These disparate tinkers, students, and inventors tend to be uniformly welleducated (or at least highly self-educated) in the principles of science, arcana, and engineering, with a particular focus on practical applications. Though most gadgeteers are at least curious about the underlying mysteries of the universe, many view groundbreaking scientific discoveries as a means to an end; theory only exists to facilitate application.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Fueled by breakthroughs and scientific advances, gadgeteers push the cutting edge of science and innovation, devising new technological marvels (or at least new blaster variants) at a breakneck pace. Some gadgeteers become absorbed in a particular problem, innovating and optimizing solutions for it alone, while others devise technological marvels wherever they can find application. All the great advances of the modern world, from datapads to Dark Matter engines, have been spearheaded by gadgeteers.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>AIs</h2>\n<p>A gadgeteer is rarely seen far from the floating holographic orb that is their Artificial Intelligence (AI) companion. After all, an organic brain can only hold so much information, whereas an AI can recall equations, trace schematics, and perform calculations with ease. Such intellect is nothing without a gadgeteer's ingenuity, of course, but the watchful eye of an AI can still spot errors that their creator might not have noticed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;But more than that, an AI companion is also a tireless friend. The endless work of a gadgeteer can often be monotonous and isolating, but the constant, friendly voice of an AI in one's ear goes a long way to preventing mad scientists and doomsday devices.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Creating a Gadgeteer</h2>\n<p>When devising your gadgeteer, consider what draws your character to the sciences. Is it the challenge of working out a new puzzle, or the thrill of perfecting a new invention? Perhaps your character is obsessed with a particular facet of the universe, and longs to unravel its mysteries. Think about how you learned about science and engineering. Did you have a mentor that shaped your understanding, or are you totally self-educated?</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, consider which Prototype you&rsquo;ll pick when you reach 2nd level. Are you interested in having a gadget for every situation, or do you just prefer having a big, hulking mech suit? Consider what this prototype means for your specialization and your character&rsquo;s personality in general. Lastly, put some thought into your AI. What&rsquo;s its name, and what type of personality does it possess, if any?</p>\n<h3>Quick Build</h3>\n<p>Follow these suggestions to quickly build a gadgeteer. Choose Intelligence as your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. Investing in Constitution might also be wise for characters that intend to select the Experimental Frame Prototype at 2nd level. For your equipment, choose a researcher&rsquo;s pack and an antimatter dagger. Lastly, choose the Technologist background.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>Class Features</h1>\n<p>As a gadgeteer, you gain the following class features:</p>\n<h3>Hit Points</h3>\n<p><strong>Hit Dice</strong>: 1d6 per gadgeteer level</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level</strong>: 6 + your Constitution modifier</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels</strong>: 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per gadgeteer level after 1st</p>\n<h3>Proficiencies</h3>\n<p><strong>Armor</strong>: Light armor</p>\n<p><strong>Weapons</strong>: Simple and martial blasters, simple weapons</p>\n<p><strong>Tools</strong>: Alchemist&rsquo;s supplies, circuitry kit, mechanist&rsquo;s tools, ship maintenance tools, smith&rsquo;s tools, tinker tools</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throws</strong>: Intelligence, Dexterity</p>\n<p><strong>Skills</strong>: Choose three from Arcana, Data, Deception, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Piloting, Religion, Sleight of Hand, or Technology</p>\n<h3>Equipment</h3>\n<p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A repeater and any simple weapon</li>\n<li>(a) a martial blaster or (b) two simple blasters</li>\n<li>(a) a circuitry kit or (b) a mechanist&rsquo;s tools</li>\n<li>An engineer&rsquo;s pack and leather armor</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>AI Companion</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 1st level, you are assisted by an AI companion, an intricate data construct which lives on your datapad and possesses near human-like levels of intelligence. When it manifests, it does so as a simple geometric projection; otherwise, it is merely a voice in your ear, checking your reasoning and informing you of relevant information. Your companion can solve any arithmetic or strictly logical problem you pose to it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Additionally, whenever you make an Intelligence (Technology) check, you can treat the result as 10, or your gadgeteer level + your Intelligence modifier, whichever is higher.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Your AI companion downloads and integrates knowledge of additional subjects as you gain higher levels in this class. At 6th level, and again at 10th level and 15th level, you can choose one of the following skills to gain this benefit when you make an Intelligence check with it: Arcana, Data, History, Investigation, Nature, or Religion.</p>\n<h2>Gadgets</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you begin to amass a collection of cutting-edge technological devices called gadgets. You gain one gadget of your choice for which you meet the prerequisites. Because your gadgets are powered by your personal power cell, no other creature can use them. If one of your gadgets is lost or damaged, you can fashion a new one for no cost when you take a long rest.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;You acquire additional gadgets as you gain levels in this class, as shown on the Gadgeteer table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the gadgets you have and replace it with another one that you could gain at that level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Your gadget options are detailed at the end of the class description.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Saving Throws</em>. If one of your gadgets calls for a saving throw, its DC is calculated as follows:</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Gadget save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<h2>Overcharge</h2>\n<p>With your technical aptitude and ingenuity, you can modify blasters to fire in more intense bursts. Starting at 2nd level, once on each of your turns when you hit a target with an attack from a blaster, you can deal an additional die of damage to that target.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;This ability improves as you gain levels in this class. You add an additional die of damage at 5th level (2 dice), 11th level (3 dice), and 17th level (4 dice). Additionally, starting at 11th level, when you use this ability, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the blaster&rsquo;s damage roll.</p>\n<h2>Prototype</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, you make a breakthrough innovation with a prototype of your own design. Choose one of the following three prototypes.</p>\n<h3>Experimental Frame</h3>\n<p>You have developed a sophisticated experimental frame, a powerful exo-suit that augments your strength and shelters you from harm. Your experimental frame counts as heavy armor, which you can don or doff as a bonus action, and it also grants you the benefits of a life suit. You are proficient with your experimental frame, but no other creature can wear it. While wearing your frame, you gain the following benefits:</p>\n<p>&bull; Your size becomes Medium, if it is smaller.</p>\n<p>&bull; Your movement speed increases to 30 feet, if it is less.</p>\n<p>&bull; Your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Intelligence modifier. This armor can't be enchanted or modified to improve its Armor Class.</p>\n<p>&bull; Whenever you begin your turn wearing this frame, you gain temporary hit points equal to your gadgeteer level. These hit points last until you remove the frame.</p>\n<p>&bull; You can integrate a simple or martial weapon directly into your frame, or you can integrate two weapons (one into each arm) if neither has the Two-Handed property. When you draw an integrated weapon, it snaps to your hand and you can&rsquo;t be disarmed of it. Your frame is programmed in all manner of combat protocol, so you can use these integrated weapons proficiently while wearing your frame, even if you're not normally proficient in their use. You can switch which weapons are integrated when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>&bull; When you make an attack with an integrated melee weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of your Strength or Dexterity, for attack and damage rolls.</p>\n<p>&bull; Starting at 5th level, when you make a melee weapon attack with an integrated weapon, you can make an additional melee attack using that weapon as a bonus action.</p>\n<h3>Mechanized Autonomous Construct</h3>\n<p>You have put the finishing touches on a @Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.monsters.gcv0riOmF3lR0gvw]{Mechanized Autonomous Construct} (a MAC), which is a speciallyconstructed automaton piloted by your AI.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The construct has statistics as shown above, and takes its own turn in combat immediately after yours. On your turn, you can mentally command your construct if it is within 500 feet of you (no action required). You decide what action it will take and where it will move during its turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. In combat, your construct's actions are governed by its Combat Protocols, which you can switch as a bonus action on your turn. If you are incapacitated or absent, your AI guides your construct to protect you and itself.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; If your construct drops to 0 hit points, it becomes disabled. When you take a long rest, you can repair your construct to its full hit points. You are always considered to have enough materials to build and repair your construct.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; You can integrate weapons and gadgets directly into your construct. You can integrate one two-handed melee weapon, two one-handed melee weapons, or a one-handed melee weapon and a gadget. When your construct draws an integrated weapon or gadget, the item snaps to its hand and it can&rsquo;t be disarmed of it. Your construct is proficient with any weapons integrated into it. The construct takes the Use an Object action to activate an integrated gadget.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Starting at 5th level, your construct makes two attacks, instead of one, when you command it to take the Attack action with its integrated weapons.</p>\n<h3>Utility Matrix</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; You have developed a utility matrix, an advanced, cubeshaped mechanism that rearranges its form and function into that of other devices. Your matrix can become any of the following gadgets, which you can use at will:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Cloaking Device</strong></em>. As an action, you can activate your cloaking device to temporarily warp the light around you and hide yourself from view. You become invisible until the beginning of your next turn, or until you make an attack, cast a spell, or use a gadget. Once you use this gadget, you can't use it again on the following round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Flashbang</strong></em>. As a bonus action, you throw a concussive bomb at your feet, disorienting and distracting nearby foes. Each creature within 5 feet of you can't take reactions until the start of its next turn. Once you use this gadget, you can't use it again on the following round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Forcefield Projector</strong></em>. As a bonus action, you can activate your forcefield projector, temporarily sheltering yourself behind a powerful electromagnetic field. Until the beginning of your next turn, your Armor Class increases by your Intelligence modifier. Once you use this gadget, you can't use it again on the following round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Grappling Hook</strong></em>. As a reaction when you fall, or as a bonus action on your turn, you can project a grappling hook at a target location you can see within your movement speed. If the target location can hold your weight, you are pulled there, expending movement normally. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. Once you use this gadget, you can't use it again on the following round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Modular Gadget</strong></em>. Starting at 5th level, you can reconfigure your utility matrix into an un-upgraded gadget of your choice that does not have prerequisites. This gadget doesn't count against your total number of gadgets known. Alternately, you can reconfigure your utility matrix into an upgrade for an existing gadget for which you meet prerequisites. Once you reconfigure your utility matrix, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2>Tech Specialty</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 3rd level, you adopt a tech specialty that informs your gadgeteering expertise. Choose one Tech Specialty option. Your selection grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>\n<h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can&rsquo;t increase an ability score<br />above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<h2>Bluescreen Protocol</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 7th level, you have integrated a complex construct-disabling algorithm into your AI companion, which you can activate as an action. Each construct within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw with disadvantage against your Gadget save DC. On a failed save, a construct is incapacitated and its speed is reduced<br />to 0 until the beginning of your next turn, even if it would otherwise be immune to being incapacitated.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h2>Override Protocol</h2>\n<p>At 18th level, your AI companion can upload a devastating virus to seize control of a construct. You can use your action to touch a construct within your reach, which must succeed a Wisdom saving throw against your Gadget save DC or be charmed by you for 1 hour, even if it would otherwise be immune to being charmed. While it is charmed, you can issue commands to the construct while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as attack that creature, run over there, or fetch that object. If the construct completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2>Antimagic Pulse</h2>\n<p>By 20th level, you perfect a cutting-edge device capable of producing an antimagic pulse (abbreviated AMP), a type of energetic burst that completely disrupts and disables magic and machines. You can use your action to throw this device to a location within 60 feet, which explodes in a flash of blue light. This device creates an antimagic field (as per the spell) for 1 minute centered on the device, with the following changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The effect is a 20-foot radius sphere.</li>\n<li>Magical technology (including your gadgets and blasters) count as magic items and are suppressed within the sphere. Blasters can&rsquo;t be used to make attacks while within the sphere, and attacks with them can&rsquo;t penetrate into it.</li>\n<li>Constructs within the sphere are paralyzed for the duration, even if they would otherwise be immune to this condition.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Destroying the device once it is thrown doesn't end its effects early. Once you use this device, it fizzles out. You can make a new one when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h1>Tech Specialties</h1>\n<p>Gadgeteers tend to be well-read on a variety of subjects, from data structures and artificial intelligence to blaster mechanics and engineering, but typically put their finest efforts into a pet project of some sort. While working on other tasks, the details of their pet project are running in the background of their minds, slowly being solved and pieced together, while other work busies their hands.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With enough experience, the subjects of a gadgeteer&rsquo;s hobby become their tech specialty, a topic in which they are as expert as they are captivated. Often, this specialty is coupled with an objective, a goal to be engineered. Gadgeteers will travel great distances to share research on their mutual specialties, exchanging breakthroughs and discoveries in an effort to achieve a common goal.</p>\n<h2>Drone Jockey</h2>\n<p>Most gadgeteers tinker with drones at some point in their career; after all, they&rsquo;re compact, useful projects, with a limited number of moving parts. However, only drone jockeys take this to the extreme of arming themselves with a small army of programmed drones. By linking the drones&rsquo; sensors and construct cores, they create a more cunning swarm intelligence, distributed over the drone network as a whole. This swarm can act almost autonomously, scouting the area and defending the jockey with mechanical efficiency.</p>\n<h3>Hivemaster</h3>\n<p>Starting when you choose this specialty, you gain a special drone controller magic item and a pair of drones. These drones can be any two of the following three: a defense drone, a medical drone, or a recon drone (see Monsters chapter for statistics). Your drone controller is linked to both drones and you can use your bonus action to command all of your drones at once.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your drones are improved in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can add your level to the HP of your drones.</li>\n<li>When one of your drones makes an attack, its attack bonus equals your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.</li>\n<li>When your medical drone heals a creature, it restores 1d10 hit points.</li>\n<li>Your recon drone marks three creatures it can see, instead of only one.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You gain an additional drone of your choice at 6th level (3 drones), 10th level (4 drones), and 14th level (5 drones).</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your <em>drone controller</em> can only command three drones at a time, and only two of those drones can be the same type, but you can deploy a stored drone as an action if one becomes disabled. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can retrofit one of your drones, changing it into a different type.</p>\n<h3>Sacrificial Dive</h3>\n<p>At 6th level, when you are targeted by a ranged attack, you can use your reaction to command one of your drones within 5 feet of you to fly in the way of the attack. This attack targets the drone instead.</p>\n<h3>Focus Fire</h3>\n<p>Beginning at 10th level, your AI companion takes direct control of your drones, aiming and firing them as you direct. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can command your drones without using a bonus action.</p>\n<h3>Omega Drone</h3>\n<p>At 14th level, as an action, you can combine three of your drones (a defense drone, a medical drone, and a recon drone) into a single omega drone. Once combined, the omega drone&rsquo;s AC equals 10 + your Intelligence modifier, its HP equals 5 times your level, and its ability scores are all 14.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The drone can take all the actions of its constituent drones and takes its own turn immediately after yours in initiative, acting as directed by your AI. On a hit with its integrated blaster, it deals 3d6 radiant damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your <em>drone controller</em> can't link to other drones while your omega drone is active. You can separate your omega drone back into its constituent drones as an action.</p>\n<h2>Futurist</h2>\n<p>As a futurist, you believe that artificial intelligence is the zenith of all invention. To engineer a perfect AI, one which is capable of inventing on its own merits, is to conquer limitless problems by proxy. After all, an advanced AI which doesn't degrade into a rogue intelligence could turn its vastly superior intellect to dramatically improving the world, innovating in ways organic minds couldn't imagine. Your experiments with neural networks and intelligence theory have steadily edged you closer to finding such an AI, and granted your AI companion newfound aptitude along the way.</p>\n<h3>Advanced Subroutines</h3>\n<p>Starting when you choose this specialty at 3rd level, your AI takes a more active role in assisting you, rather than merely chirping up from time to time. Your AI can run any of the following subroutines, and you can command it to switch between subroutines as a bonus action.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Genetic Algorithm</em>. When you take damage from a hostile creature, subtract 1 from the damage dealt. Each additional time you take damage while this subroutine is running, the amount you subtract from the damage dealt increases by 1, up to a maximum of your Intelligence modifier. This amount resets to 1 after 1 minute or when you switch subroutines.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Heatmap</em>. When you have advantage on a weapon attack, you can add your proficiency bonus to the damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Neural Network</em>. When you use the Attack action to attack a hostile creature and miss, you gain a cumulative +1 bonus to subsequent attack rolls you make while this subroutine is running, up to a maximum of your Intelligence modifier. You don't increase this bonus if you attempt to attack a creature that you can't see or a creature that can't be hit. This amount resets to 0 after 1 minute or when you switch subroutines.</p>\n<h3>Novel Intelligence</h3>\n<p>At 3rd level, you have vastly improved your AI's intellect. Your AI Companion feature applies its benefit to another Intelligence skill of your choice. Additionally, your AI knows all languages and can perfectly recall everything it has seen and heard within the last 30 days.</p>\n<h3>Tactical Analysis</h3>\n<p>Starting at 6th level, as a bonus action, you can command your AI to perform a full evaluation of your strategic options and advise you of likely scenarios. Until the beginning of your next turn, you have advantage on the next attack roll you make, and the next attack roll made against you has disadvantage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Recursive Deterrence</h3>\n<p>By 10th level, your AI has implemented passive routines that scan for incoming blaster fire and ready you for counterattack. As a reaction when a creature within 15 feet of you makes a ranged weapon attack, you can use your reaction to make a ranged weapon attack targeting that creature.</p>\n<h3>Singularity</h3>\n<p>Beginning at 14th level, your AI is nearly prescient. As a bonus action, you can allow your AI to override your very movements, guiding your shots to where targets will be. For the next minute, whenever you make a ranged attack roll and don't have disadvantage, you can treat the result as being equal to your gadgeteer level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Hardlight Architect</h3>\n<p>Hardlight might well be the penultimate arcane discovery. It is a strong yet malleable material, conjured fully-shaped from energy alone, and it can be used to construct entire functional systems in a flash. Through hardlight, engineers and arcanists can spontaneously prototype new designs in real space and replicate these designs later. Hardlight architects recognize the monumental importance of this material and dedicate their ambition and creativity to mastering it. As you perfect all the established hardlight spells, you constantly dream up new, innovative uses for the material, awaiting the day you can conjure a towering suit of hardlight power armor to crush your enemies and intimidate your rivals.</p>\n<h3>Hardlight Projector</h3>\n<p>When you choose this specialty at 3rd level, you construct a hardlight projector, a device capable of forming hardlight and shaping it to your whims. If the projector is lost or destroyed, you can construct a new one over a long rest for 200 gp. By using this device as an action, you can create a simple geometrical object of shimmering hardlight which must fit within a 1-foot cube. Whatever its shape, the object weighs 1 pound, lasts for 1 minute, has AC 10, and has 5 hit points.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Additionally, you can use the projector to cast the @Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.spells.CsNvRRgV7yDrKnZ6]{hardlight needle} cantrip.</p>\n<h3>Hardlight Spellcasting</h3>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, you can use your hardlight projector to emulate the actions of a spellcaster, enabling you to create more substantial hardlight spells. Your spell save DC for these spells equals your Gadget save DC and your spell attack bonus equals your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You can cast the spells hardlight blaster and hardlight nails once each and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Additionally, at 6th level, you can cast the spells hardlight construction and hardlight gauntlet once each. At 14th level, you can cast the spell hardlight frame once. You regain the ability to cast each of these spells when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Lightforge</h3>\n<p>Starting at 6th level, as a bonus action, you can forge a shield, a set of artisan tools, or any melee weapon that deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, entirely out of scintillating hardlight. After 10 minutes, this object evaporates completely into light.</p>\n<h3>Prototype Luxcannon</h3>\n<p>By 10th level, you&rsquo;ve perfected a stable hardlight weapon, which you can conjure effortlessly. You can cast the spell hardlight blaster at will and can apply your Overcharge feature to the spell.</p>\n<h3>Transient Avatar</h3>\n<p>At 14th level, you can cast the spell conjure hardlight avatar without using a spell slot or spell components as a bonus action. The spell's duration is until the end of your next turn. Once you cast this spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2>Mastermaker</h2>\n<p><img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"worlds/dm-start/images/items/classes/avia-ra-gadgeteer.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"198\" />Nearly all gadgeteers strive for perfection in their work, but mastermakers take this to a logical extreme: using the technology at their disposal, they seek to engineer away their own biological defects. By grafting gadgets and technology onto their bodies (and making liberal use of vect components), mastermakers gradually become hybrids of humanoids and machines. They are stronger, tougher, and more agile than their counterparts, but many would argue that their techniques are too extreme&mdash;too unnatural&mdash;no matter what the results.</p>\n<h3>Thermalsight</h3>\n<p>Starting when you choose this specialty at 3rd level, you have installed a vect optical sensor in place of one of your eyes, granting you thermalsight. You can see living creatures through darkness and heavily obscured conditions, such as fog, out to a range of 30 feet. You can also determine if a creature is living or dead though its body heat. However, you can't discern color, nor use this sense to see through illusions, invisibility, or magical darkness. This sense is blocked by one inch of any solid barrier. If you already had thermalsight, its range increases by 30 feet.</p>\n<h3>Embedded Gadgets</h3>\n<p>At 3rd level, you can install one gadget or a one-handed blaster directly into one of your arms. You can&rsquo;t be disarmed of this item and you can use it if at least one of your hands is free. Additionally, you can perfectly conceal this item, so long as another creature does not inspect the metal plates installed in your arm. You can change which gadget or blaster you have embedded when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Additionally, you don&rsquo;t lose hit points or hit dice from installing or removing construct grafts, and it takes you no time to recover after the attachment of a new graft.</p>\n<h3>Carbon Fiber Skin</h3>\n<p>At 6th level, you have installed a durable metallic mesh under much of your skin, and metallic plates to protect your organs. Your Armor Class increases by 1.</p>\n<h3>Reconfigure</h3>\n<p>By 10th level, enough of your body is mechanical that you can reconfigure your parts to improve your agility, might, or even intellect. One ability score of your choice increases by 2 and you can change this selection whenever you finish a long rest. You can't increase Constitution using this trait and you can't increase any ability score above 20.</p>\n<h3>Construct Perfection</h3>\n<p>By 14th level, you have achieved the height of construct superiority by installing a construct core directly into your head. You no longer need to sleep and magic can&rsquo;t put you to sleep. You are immune to being charmed, frightened, or possessed. Additionally, the maximum for your Intelligence score is now 22.</p>\n<h2>Nanoengineer</h2>\n<p>While other gadgeteers tinker with machines that fit in the palm of your hand, your machinations are smaller and your ambitions grander. As a nanoengineer, you work with nanomachines, unfathomably tiny robots capable of massive feats, from stitching together wounds at the microscopic level, to forming extraordinarily resilient materials. Your machines might appear as nothing more than a small blob of gray ooze, but once set to work, their effects are unmistakable.</p>\n<h3>Cutting-Edge Nanobots</h3>\n<p>Beginning when you choose this specialty at 3rd level, you have assembled a fabricator which generates a steady stream of advanced nanobots, called nanites. Your supply of nanites is represented by a pool of Nano points equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your gadgeteer level, rounded down. You can expend Nano points to employ your nanobots in varying ways, described below, and you regain all expended Nano points when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Deconstruct</em>. As an action, you well up a mass of nanites in your hand and fling them at a target within 15 feet of you. Spend any number of Nano points and make a ranged attack roll if the target is out of your reach; you automatically hit if the target is within your reach. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 necrotic damage per Nano point expended as the nanites unravel it at a cellular level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Nano-Hack</em>. You can expend up to 3 Nano points when you make an Intelligence (Data) check to hack a piece of technology, inserting your nanites into the machine. You can add 1d4 to the roll for each Nano point expended.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Reconstruct</em>. As an action, you can expend any number of Nano points to create a thin stream of nanites to repair damage and mend wounds of a willing target within 15 feet of you. The target regains 1d6 hit points per Nano point expended.</p>\n<h3>Nano-Duplicate</h3>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, as a bonus action, you can use your nanites to duplicate the exact shape, but not color or texture, of an object you touch that can fit within a 1-foot cube. The replica is made of nanites and lasts for 10 minutes.</p>\n<h3>Recycling Protocol</h3>\n<p>Starting at 6th level, you've programmed your nanites to repurpose material and multiply. When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points using a melee weapon attack or your Deconstruct ability, you regain 2 expended Nano points.</p>\n<h3>Nanite Weave</h3>\n<p>Starting at 10th level, you can use your action and spend up to 3 Nano points to stitch your nanites together in a protective mesh above your skin. These Nano points are invested in the mesh; you can have up to 3 points invested at once. While you aren't wielding a shield, you gain a bonus to your Armor Class equal to the number of Nano points invested. Whenever you take damage, nanites in the mesh are destroyed and you lose 1 invested point.</p>\n<h3>Network Response</h3>\n<p>Starting at 14th level, you can use your reaction when you take damage to use your Deconstruct ability, targeting the attacker, or Reconstruct ability, targeting yourself, spending up to 3 Nano points on either ability.</p>\n<h1>Gadgets</h1>\n<p><img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"worlds/dm-start/images/items/classes/death-ray-a.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"212\" /></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Your 'death ray' is just a blaster which kills people? I have an axe that kills people. Does that make it a 'death axe'?\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;- Throg, half-orc barbarian who asks really good questions</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If a gadget or an upgrade has prerequisites, you must meet them to gain it. You can gain a gadget or upgrade at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your gadgets count as magical technology. You must have a gadget before you can select its upgrade. If a gadget calls for a spell or magic item which requires a saving throw, its uses your Gadget save DC.</p>\n<h3>Adaptable Omnitool</h3>\n<p>This gadget can be configured into a number of useful devices, including the following:</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Auto-Entry Device</em>. This device automatically attempts to crack physical locks or hack powered doors when set to do so as an action. Its ability check for doing so is 10 + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Rebreather</em>. You can start or stop breathing through this apparatus as a bonus action. When doing so, you can breathe normally in airless environments. This device also shelters you from toxic fumes and other airborne poisons. You can't talk while breathing through this device.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Scanner</em>. As an action, you can use your handheld scanner to analyze the electromagnetic spectrum around you. Your scanner detects the presence, number, and type of technological devices within 30 feet of you and can determine whether or not a unique construct or device has been present in the area within the last hour.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Taser</em>. This device produces a debilitating current of electricity when you use it as an action. Make a melee attack roll (attack bonus equals your Intelligence bonus + your proficiency modifier) against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 lightning damage, and it can't take reactions until the start of its next turn. This damage increases to 2d8 lightning damage at when you reach 5th level, 3d8 at 11th level, and 4d8 at 17th level.</p>\n<h3>Blink Button</h3>\n<p>This complicated looking device has a single large red button on its face. When you press it as an action, you teleport up to 15 feet to an unoccupied location of your choice that you can see.</p>\n<h3>Bubble Projector</h3>\n<p>You construct a device that, as an action, creates a dome of force as if you had cast the spell geodesic shield. You don't need to concentrate on this spell. Once you use this gadget, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Chronoshifter</h3>\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 17th level</em></p>\n<p>When you use your bonus action to activate this sophisticated, spherical device, you temporarily distort time, as per the spell time stop. Once you use this gadget, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Death Ray</h3>\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 17th level</em></p>\n<p>You construct a death ray magic item.</p>\n<h3>F-MAC</h3>\n<p><em>Prerequisites: Mechanized Autonomous Construct prototype, 5th level</em></p>\n<p>You integrate a set of thrusters into your construct, granting it a flying speed of 30 feet.</p>\n<h3>Feedback Electrodes</h3>\n<p><em>Prerequisites: Utility Matrix Prototype, 5th level</em></p>\n<p>You&rsquo;ve installed an electrical feedback system into your Utility Matrix. When you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to deal 2d6 lightning damage to that creature.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This damage improves as you gain higher levels in this class. At 11th level, you can deal 3d6 damage, and at 17th level, you can deal 4d6 damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","img":"worlds/dm-start/images/items/classes/avia-ra-gadgeteer.png","_id":"ILsqkzVXAUcUGqUq"}

{"name":"Appendix E: Hazards","permission":{"default":0,"PmXouJxFyK2lSXOA":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.UCJdFLoVKKwj7WqG"}},"content":"<h1>Appendix E: Hazards</h1>\n<p>While spaceflight can be tricky and downright dangerous, it&rsquo;s not quite the suicidal venture some make it out to be. With the right gear, the right ship, and the right crew, you&rsquo;re almost guaranteed to make it from your initial port of call to wherever you&rsquo;re heading, barring some unforeseen circumstances.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; That said, below are listed a number of potential hazards that could adversely affect your ability to get around the &lsquo;verse:</p>\n<h2>Dead Magic Zone</h2>\n<p>Where the edges of space wear thin, the fabric of magic has torn, leaving immense Dead Magic Zones in space where no arcana can exist. These regions behave much like antimagic zones and influence magical technology in the same way as magic items. Additionally, constructs within the zones are paralyzed, even if they would otherwise be immune to this condition.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; Vect, as living constructs, are not fully disabled within a Dead Magic Zone, but develop stutters in their voices and movement, and gain a level of exhaustion which can&rsquo;t be removed while they remain in the zone.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; Ships can no longer move, and all their systems and weapons are fully disabled. Thankfully, even void crystals fall inert, or the resulting shutdown of the ship&rsquo;s Dark Matter engine would be catastrophic. Gnomish technology, which is built on scientific principles, can operate normally in Dead Magic Zones.</p>\n<h2>Extreme Temperature</h2>\n<p>Few places in the galaxy are a comfortable temperature for organic life. The Black is an endless icy nothingness, whereas stars are universally scorching hellscapes; the friendly bands between these extremes, where organic life can comfortably exist, are few and far-between. Very hot and very cold terrestrial temperatures generally call for creatures to make Constitution saving throws (the DC varying based upon the temperature) to avoid exhaustion and other hazards, such as frostbite and sunburns. However, extreme temperatures, such as those found in space, are immediately life threatening.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; At the beginning of its turn, an unprotected creature exposed to extreme cold or extreme heat takes 1d6 cold or fire damage, respectively. If still exposed at the beginning of its next turn, the creature takes 2d6 damage, and 3d6 damage at the beginning of the turn following that, and so on, up to a maximum of 10d6. Even more extreme temperatures will begin damage with a higher number of damage dice, at the GM's discretion.</p>\n<h2>N-Virus</h2>\n<p>The N-Virus is a magical disease which affects only constructs and can lay dormant in machines for some time. Living constructs, such as vect and android characters, are particularly vulnerable, as the virus completely overwrites their personalities as it runs its course.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; If a construct comes in physical contact with a construct infected with the virus or uses an arcane terminal or other device infected with it, it must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become infected. Symptoms are minor at first, consisting of malfunctions and instances of faulty logic, but as the virus moves to dominate the construct's core, the virus reveals its true nature. The virus intelligently delays its progression, lying dormant for up to 30 days, until more constructs are infected or the infected construct has escaped quarantine.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; A construct with the N-Virus develops a fiendish intelligence and the sinister obsession of spreading the virus further. The construct's Intelligence score becomes 16 if it were lower. An infected character&rsquo;s alignment becomes chaotic evil, and it gains the following ideal: &ldquo;I will spread the N-Virus at all costs.&rdquo; The GM can take control of the character until the virus is removed. Additionally, an infected construct gains the ability to instill faults within machines, gaining the following trait:</p>\n<p>&nbsp; <strong><em>Innate Spellcasting</em></strong>. The infected construct&rsquo;s innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Intelligence modifier). The construct can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:</p>\n<p>&nbsp; At will:<em> @Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.spells.iYy45F5DU44zHtyS]{Technomancy}<br /></em>&nbsp; 3/day each: <em>@Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.spells.1ij2fHMyS59YyAMq]{Circuit Breaker}, @Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.spells.5r1sXVUPLHZF0RGS]{Perception Hack}, @Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.spells.zvpGryu96V628cDl]{Technical Difficulties}<br /></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp; The N-Virus can be prevented with the&nbsp;<em>@Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.spells.AddqDjJ6UHgyEVh2]{Antivirus} </em>spell. It can be cured with the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.F0GsG0SJzsIOacwV]{Lesser Restoration} spell while it lays dormant, but once it progresses, it can only be cured with a @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.WzvJ7G3cqvIubsLk]{Greater Restoration} spell, or similar magic, or if the character is killed and returned to life.</p>\n<h2>Radiation</h2>\n<p>Even brief exposure to hazardous radiation can kill, as evidenced by the bursts of radiant energy produced by blasters, but prolonged exposure can be just as deadly. A creature that spends one minute exposed to radiation must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for one hour. While poisoned, the creature's hit point maximum is decreased by 5. Each subsequent failed saving throw against radiation while the creature is poisoned increases the duration the creature is poisoned by an additional hour and decreases its hit point maximum by an additional 5. If a creature&rsquo;s hit point maximum is reduced to 0, it dies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; Lastly, when a creature that has been poisoned due to radiation recovers from being poisoned, roll a d20. On a 1, the creature suffers a severe side effect from the poisoning: an aneurysm or a cancerous growth. The creature's hit point maximum is halved until it is healed by a&nbsp;<em>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.WzvJ7G3cqvIubsLk]{Greater Restoration} </em>spell or similar magic.</p>\n<h2>Roach Addiction</h2>\n<p>Long term consumption of @Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.equipment.eJCSiBzANab4dEvs]{Ocoulori Radavitis}, also known as \"roaches\", is addictive and dangerous. Roaches are sentient and psychic creatures, and their violent deaths gradually wear down the psyche of those who eat them. When a creature consumes a roach, it must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it becomes addicted and gains one randomly-determined @Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.rolltables.JfQLnO61Sc9ZMYWb]{Indefinite Madness} trait. While addicted, it gains a level of exhaustion whenever it goes longer than 7 days without consuming a roach. Each time it fails this Wisdom save, it gains an additional Indefinite Madness trait and the time before exhaustion sets in decreases by 1 day, to a minimum of 1 day. Addiction can be ended by a <em>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl]{Remove Curse}</em> spell and its lingering madness traits can be cured by a <em>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.WzvJ7G3cqvIubsLk]{Greater Restoration}</em> spell or similar magic.</p>\n<h2>Vacuum</h2>\n<p>The vacuum of space is the apex of hazards; its extreme temperature and complete absence of air are universally lethal. No creature can hold its breath in a vacuum. Upon entering a vacuum without a breathing apparatus, a creature can survive a number of rounds equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum 2 rounds). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hits points and is dying.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; A creature with a breathing apparatus might still be subject to Extreme Temperature if it doesn't have other protective equipment.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; Casting a spell with a verbal component is impossible in a vacuum.</p>\n<h2>Variable Gravity</h2>\n<p>Though it&rsquo;s natural to take gravitational forces for granted while on a planet or within a ship with artificial gravity, the &lsquo;verse abounds with different gravitational environments, each of which pose a unique challenge to spacers and explorers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; <em>Zero Gravity</em>. Whenever a ship loses its life support system while in the Black or someone decides to go on a spacewalk, they experience zero gravity. In zero gravity environments, creatures and objects hang in the air until they are moved. A creature in zero gravity can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. Its speed is otherwise reduced to zero. Once a creature or object is set into motion, it can&rsquo;t stop moving until it collides with an obstacle. A creature automatically continues its movement at the same speed at the beginning of its turn, and an object set in motion moves with the same speed each round after it was moved.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; Creatures and objects in an area of zero gravity have no weight, but still may require some strength to push.</p>\n<p><em>&nbsp; Low Gravity</em>. Planetoids, asteroids, and moons with any sort of gravity will have low gravity, which only tenuously draws objects to the surface after allowing them to linger in the air for some time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; In low gravity, the weight of all creatures and objectsis halved. A creature in low gravity can jump twice the normal height and distance. Additionally, a creature takes half damage from falling in low gravity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; <em>High Gravity</em>. High gravity conditions are common in the &lsquo;verse, as it is the default environment for large and dense planets, though it also occurs whenever a ship strays too close to a massive object, such as a star or a black hole.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; Each creature in an area of high gravity area must spend two feet of movement for every foot moved, including flying, jumping, and climbing movement. This can be combined with difficult terrain to slow movement to a quarter of normal speed. If a prone creature wishes to stand up, it must succeed on a DC 12 Strength check. On a failure, it can&rsquo;t move at all on its turn.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; Objects in the area, including those being worn or carried, weigh double their usual weight, which therefore may cause creatures to become encumbered or cause loadbearing spells like levitate to fail. Creatures and objects take double damage from falling.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; <em>Extreme Gravity</em>. While high gravity can be tolerated for some time, extreme gravity is outright lethal. Extreme gravity carries all the penalties of high gravity, but a creature makes all Strength and Dexterity ability checks and saving throws with disadvantage. Additionally, at the beginning of its turn, a creature in extreme gravity takes bludgeoning damage based on its size: a Small creature takes 1d4 bludgeoning damage, a Medium creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage, a Large creature takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage, a Huge creature takes 1d10 bludgeoning damage, and a Gargantuan creature takes 1d12 bludgeoning damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","img":"modules/game-icons-net/blackbackground/radioactive.svg","_id":"SHlLQZItkQs9P0Wd"}

The Cabal is an enterprising office of soul brokers, who arrange lucrative contracts in exchange for parts of a signee&rsquo;s soul. Such contracts are fair, clearly spelled-out, and never offered unsolicited; moreover, most contracts exchange only a percentage of the signee&rsquo;s soul for a disbursement. One percent of a soul could be worth a few thousand credits, whereas ten percent could buy a brand-new starship, place a down payment on a house, and leave some left over in the bank. Signees are free to decide from a number of generous disbursement packages and receive prompt payment for their souls.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;This method of soul contracting isn't just efficient, but it represents a triumph of the free market. The soul brokers who work for the Cabal need not worry about signing mortal bargains for entire souls at once; they each collect dozens of souls a year, taken from hundreds of different signees. Those who sign such contracts need not worry about being damned to the Lower Planes for eternity as a part of their bargain; instead, they can (probably) expect their afterlives will be merely tarnished, as only part of their eternal soul ascends. They can even return to sign additional contracts. Best of all, the process doesn&rsquo;t require any tiresome blood rituals or fiendish temptation, as the Cabal operates out of ordinary office buildings.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Cabal was founded by Mr. Bell, secretly a highranking devil named Belphagor. At the time he arrived on the Material Plane, soul trading was a clumsy affair, requiring a creature to trade its entire soul for one favor, which was rarely as valuable as the soul itself. While this system meant that devils almost always profited on their deals, it also meant that far fewer creatures were willing to barter with them. To remedy this, Belphagor derived the exact monetary value for a mortal soul and a system by which to trade away only a small portion of it. Before long, human greed and the free market ran away with the idea. Belphagor no longer needed to send imps to haggle with mortals; they were coming to him. Under the guise of Mr. Bell, he purchased an office, hired a staff of tieflings, and opened for business as the Cabal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Cabal will hire anyone that passes the prerequisite legal and brokerage exams, but prefers tiefling employees for their natural silver tongues and infernal blood. Soul brokers can also be hired to oversee other legal matters, as most soul brokers become qualified lawyers before taking the brokerage exams.</p>\n<h2>The Coalition</h2>\n<div><img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/the-coalition.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"256\" height=\"135\" /></div>\n<p>Based on the militarized world of Fraxus-12 on the outer rim, the Coalition is the largest private military corporation in the &lsquo;verse. Established five hundred years ago by a group of defected military leaders, the Coalition purportedly maintains a standing army of nearly a billion soldiers, with an armada to match. While these numbers pale in comparison to the military might of the elves, dwarves, or humans, Coalition soldiers are exceptionally well-trained and equipped, making them more than a match for any combatant. Though Coalition soldiers can be hired as bodyguards or mercenaries, the Coalition&rsquo;s specialty is turning the tide of galactic conflict (for the right price).</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Coalition is led by a council of generals, admirals, and sky marshals called the War Room. This council of military experts debates tactics, establishes new military doctrine, and even deliberates on changes to the Coalition soldier&rsquo;s basic uniform. The War Room is presided over by the current High Lord Marshal, Tiberious Vinter, an imposing half-orc with nearly a century of combat experience and a prodigiously impressive beard. In the War Room, the High Lord Marshal&rsquo;s word is law and his decisions are final; and to his credit, Marshal Vinter rarely makes decisions rashly or without deliberation. He and his council are all too aware that their actions carry the weight of millions of lives, which none of them take lightly.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Though the Coalition will join any war effort which can afford their services, all of its soldiers abide by a strict code of warfare. This code prohibits slavery, genocide, planetary destruction (excluding Tier 4 and 5 worlds), and out-and-out piracy. Any soldier or officer found to be engaging in such activity will be immediately censured and subjected to military tribunal. As such, even though the Coalition operates in the same theater as other mercenary groups, such as Grax&rsquo;s Guys and Scale and Fang, they are treated with a measure of respect that elevates them from the competition.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Next to its incredible armada, the Coalition&rsquo;s greatest asset might be its chapter of warmages. During the Rift War of humanity, the old Warmage College was split between fighting the Elven Forest-Fleet for the Alliance or fighting the Orcish Warhorde with Lakshay. When the dust settled, Lakshay separated from the Alliance and the College of Warmages pledged their devotion to the new government of Lakshay. Warmage loyalists were appalled, and many defected to join the Coalition, a force they saw as a neutral camp between the alliances of humanity. Today, the Coalition employs its warmages as a cutting-edge force of arcane troops, blending combative magic with new technology, giving Coalition forces an unparalleled tactical advantage on the field of battle.</p>\n<h2>DD&amp;D</h2>\n<div><img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/ddnd.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"256\" height=\"252\" /></div>\n<p>Based out of four exceedingly high-class offices on the four maws surrounding the galactic core, Drog, Dusset, &amp; Durgen Acquisitions &amp; Trade is the premier high-tier trade organization and antiquities dealer in the galaxy.

Of these adventures, the most successful (and longest lived) are offered positions as Artifactors, operating as the organization&rsquo;s premier tradesmen and dungeon delvers. Artifactors plan and oversee DD&amp;D&rsquo;s high profile expeditions, and are afforded exceptional manpower and resources to do so.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The oft-quoted tale of DD&amp;D&rsquo;s origins involves the titular founders, now all (presumably) long dead, aiding an eternal dragon named Garfreckt in moving its hoard from one edge of space to another. According to the story, the founders discovered a new hoard-planet for the dragon, the remnant core of a dead gas giant, now a planet-sized ball of pure diamond, and helped the dragon move into this new home. In exchange, the dragon parted with a few of its baubles (all legendary magic items), which the founders traded to establish their company. Of course, such a tale is more or less impossible to verify, but most acquisitions agents agree that, if anyone could have done it, their founders could have.</p>\n<h2>The Firm</h2>\n<div><img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/the-firm.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"256\" height=\"256\" /></div>\n<p>At first blush, it can be hard to tell that any part of the Firm&rsquo;s dealings is illicit; after all, its contracts are watertight, its checks never bounce, and its lawyers are impeccable. Those in the know, however, understand that, for all its business accoutrement, the Firm is the largest organized crime syndicate in the &lsquo;verse.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;To conduct its various illegal operations, which include hacking, weapons trafficking, and elaborate heists, the Firm hires short-term Contractors, individuals speciallyrecruited to match the details of a particular job. Contractors are abundant and varied, including everyone from expert hackers to common thugs, but all are expected to follow their contracts to the letter, regardless of what deeds they entail. Many Contractors even play the part of businessmen with aplomb. By their nature, Contractors are compartmentalized and ultimately expendable; no single Contractor knows details which might incriminate the Firm&rsquo;s Management, and if they become a problem, their contract can be terminated, usually via unprotected spacewalk.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Due to the shadowy nature of the Firm&rsquo;s dealings, concrete details on its Management can be hard to come by. Rumors abound, however, that the Firm&rsquo;s Middle-Managers can be tracked down on Hearthstations across the &lsquo;verse. Of course, the implication is that, while halflings make comfortable beds and serve a warm meal, they&rsquo;re also pulling illicit money on the side. A halfling&rsquo;s light feet are excellent for thieving, after all, should they feel so inclined. Most Firm communications with the Middle-Managers also leverage gnomish technology, opening the quiet and inaccessible Dead Magic Zones for secret meetings and also blocking most magical forms of tracking. Thus, it is hard to know for sure who hires Contractors and who devises their jobs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;A strangely prominent rumor holds that the small Board of Directors which directs the Firm&rsquo;s activities meets aboard a private warship called the Upper Management. Whether or not this rumor holds any truth is anyone&rsquo;s guess, but seeing as the Firm&rsquo;s reach stretches across the &lsquo;verse, into practically every maw station and world on the grid, it&rsquo;s unwise to underestimate their resources.</p>","_id":"Z2eUfNeY4TQK9wfE"}

By their nature, Contractors are compartmentalized and ultimately expendable; no single Contractor knows details which might incriminate the Firm&rsquo;s Management, and if they become a problem, their contract can be terminated, usually via unprotected spacewalk.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Due to the shadowy nature of the Firm&rsquo;s dealings, concrete details on its Management can be hard to come by. Rumors abound, however, that the Firm&rsquo;s Middle-Managers can be tracked down on Hearthstations across the &lsquo;verse. Of course, the implication is that, while halflings make comfortable beds and serve a warm meal, they&rsquo;re also pulling illicit money on the side. A halfling&rsquo;s light feet are excellent for thieving, after all, should they feel so inclined. Most Firm communications with the Middle-Managers also leverage gnomish technology, opening the quiet and inaccessible Dead Magic Zones for secret meetings and also blocking most magical forms of tracking. Thus, it is hard to know for sure who hires Contractors and who devises their jobs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;A strangely prominent rumor holds that the small Board of Directors which directs the Firm&rsquo;s activities meets aboard a private warship called the Upper Management. Whether or not this rumor holds any truth is anyone&rsquo;s guess, but seeing as the Firm&rsquo;s reach stretches across the &lsquo;verse, into practically every maw station and world on the grid, it&rsquo;s unwise to underestimate their resources.</p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/astrogations-alp.png","_id":"OVPK47UnxyLjcqaz"}
{"name":"Chapter 1: Factions (G-Z)","permission":{"default":0,"PmXouJxFyK2lSXOA":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.ZMSoTxbKZ2TlEO2Q"}},"content":"<h1>Factions</h1>\n<p>Outside of the major galactic alliances founded by the spacefaring races, there are countless other factions that a well-traveled adventurer may do business for, have a run-in with, or even join as a member. While all factions have a specific goal in mind, be that spreading a belief, exploring unknown worlds, or simply making a lot of money, most have smaller ambitions than the galactic governments and keep their membership open to creatures of many races.</p>\n<h2>Grax&rsquo;s Guys for Cheap</h2>\n<div><img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/graxs-guys.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"256\" height=\"244\" /></div>\n<p>Not to be confused with Grax&rsquo;s Cheap Guys (a wholly different company), Grax&rsquo;s Guys for Cheap is one of the most prolific mercenary services in the &lsquo;verse. Operating at least one bar/inn/business office on every maw on the grid (including those on the outer rim), GGFC is often seen as one of the more stable sources of income a decent, hardworking adventurer can come across, so long as they don&rsquo;t mind the fifteen percent finder&rsquo;s fee (and the smell). &nbsp; &nbsp;Established over fifty years ago, Grax&rsquo;s Guys for Cheap is the lifetime project of Grax Grraxe, an orcish warlord who left the Warzone to escape the constant bloodshed, explosions, and general unpleasantness. Finding that he couldn't obtain decent work on any planet he visited (at least, work that didn&rsquo;t involve clubbing someone in the knees), Grax moved to the outer ring, sold his ship, and set about establishing a company that would accept anyone as a patron or employee. Today, no other mercenary service in the &lsquo;verse is as widespread. While others may have nicer equipment, have better training, or fly around in nicer ships, none can match Grax&rsquo;s Guys for sheer numbers or tenacity; also, Grax serves the best beer.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;GGFC operates somewhat differently to most other mercenary companies. While they aren't averse to the usual bodyguard duty, security detail, or military backup that most mercs expect, prospective employers can ask almost anything of Grax&rsquo;s Guys: a given merc might take a job shipping Rosvalian star pigs across the galaxy, only to then act as a short order cook in the restaurant those pigs are served at. This wide net of job postings has been a cornerstone of Grax&rsquo;s success. Grax&rsquo;s Guys will take nearly any job, provided that it is both legal in most galactic territories and the pay is acceptable, with a halfup- front deposit. Their tagline &ldquo;You can trust Grax!&rdquo; can be seen advertised in almost every port in the &lsquo;verse.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Since its inception, Grax has made a point to offer regular contracts to mercs from disenfranchised and distrusted races, particularly half-breeds. His experience attempting to find gainful employment after departing the Warzone keyed him in to the need for reliable and legal employment for the galaxy&rsquo;s outcasts. Not to mention the fact that half-orcs are tough and easy to hire.</p>\n<h2>S.S. Saint Vincent</h2>\n<div><img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/s.s.-saint-vincent.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"256\" height=\"245\" /></div>\n<p>For over a hundred years, colonists and homesteaders on the edge of the Galactic Frontier have told legends and tales about the &ldquo;White Angel of the Outer Rim.&rdquo; When bandits began to overrun their homes, the angel appeared in the sky, ready to mete out justice. When natural disaster threatened their worlds, the angel arrived and ferried them to safety. And when slaughter, death, or capture came from off-world, the angel came to burn their foes with holy fire.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;While not a literal guardian angel, the S.S. Saint Vincent might be the closest thing that most folks of the Frontier have to one. The Saint Vincent is a single starkwhite human battleship, a Warbringer-class vessel, owned and operated by volunteer peacekeepers and lawmen, seeking to bring order and justice to lawless space. Led by the unflappable Capt. Banoris Starfall, the crew of the Saint Vincent are often the only thing standing in the way of utter chaos on the Frontier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The greatest foe that threatens the Saint Vincent is the wrothian menace, which preys upon Frontier worlds with impunity. A constant game of cat and mouse, the Saint Vincent tries to be everywhere at once, patrolling thousands of endangered worlds while probing the Black for the slumbering wrothian ships. Only in rare moments of dramatic confrontation does the Saint Vincent corner and exchange blows with its nemeses, but it is only a matter of time until one side or the other is destroyed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Saint Vincent is named for a cleric of legend who is said to have written the first laws of High Terra, which were passed to him from the gods. These laws listed every conceivable crime, but had no punishments: Saint Vincent&rsquo;s cudgel would be the sole arbiter of all sin. Today, the White Angel of the Outer Rim carries this maverick sense of justice to the far stars, protecting worlds the other factions have never seen and combating threats they have never heard of.</p>\n<h2>Scale &amp; Fang Inc.</h2>\n<div><img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/scale-n-fang.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"256\" height=\"253\" /></div>\n<p>Notoriously tough, formidable, and armed to the teeth, Scale and Fang bodyguards cut a menacing figure. In the mercenary world, Scale and Fang Inc. is known for hiring the most powerfully-built bodyguards available (notably many dragonborn) who will dive in front of a blaster bolt at a moment&rsquo;s notice for their charge. These bodyguards are the finest in the &lsquo;verse, specializing in escorting highclass clientele through dangerous areas. In fact, it&rsquo;s rare to see a Hegemony governor or an elven aristocrat walking the maws without a posse of Scale and Fang dragonborn.&nbsp; Though clients should expect to pay handsomely for the protection service, they can rest easy knowing that Scale and Fang are watching over them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Headquartered in a planetoid made of pure diamond near Draxel, Scale and Fang is funded largely by the eternal dragon, Garfreckt. Purportedly, Garfreckt founded the company when he lost a bet with an elven adventurer and promised away his small army of dragonborn minions to help complete the elf&rsquo;s quest. When the dragonborn returned, they were accompanied by a half-dozen others, each wishing to inquire how to enlist the dragonborn for their own services. Because of the dragonborn&rsquo;s expertise in protecting their master and his hoard, their skills were tailor-made to keeping watch over others, and thus Scale and Fang was born.</p>\n<h2>Temple of the Chosen</h2>\n<div><img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/temple-of-the-chosen.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"256\" height=\"191\" /></div>\n<p>While most religions are strictly tied to the planets from which their gods originate, there is at least one church gaining a foothold throughout the &lsquo;verse. The Temple of the Chosen venerates a diverse pantheon of spacefarers, who each, it is said, ascended from their mortal forms and attained godhood, granting them dominion over the entire galaxy. This pantheon, known as the Chosen, contains no names, only titles corresponding to their god&rsquo;s position aboard their celestial spacecraft, the Ark:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>The Captain</em>. Usually depicted as a human male, the Captain gives orders to his celestial crew, and is in turn supported by them.</li>\n<li><em>The First Mate</em>. Often depicted as an elven female, the First Mate advises the Captain and critiques his decisions, but also enforces them should they be deemed proper and good.</li>\n<li><em>The Pilot</em>. A female gnome, the Pilot flies the Ark through the Black, deftly avoiding all obstacles.</li>\n<li><em>The Astrogator</em>. The Astrogator is typically a male avia-ra and guides the Pilot through the stars, ensuring she always knows the correct path to fly.</li>\n<li><em>The Cook</em>. A male halfling, the Cook provides celestial sustenance to the crew, and fatherly advice to all who desire it.</li>\n<li><em>The Doc</em>. The Doc, depicted as a female half-orc, tends to the wounds and fatigue of the crew, and keeps her charges healthy and fit.</li>\n<li><em>The Engineer</em>. The Engineer, a dwarven male, keeps the engines of the Ark running at all times, and ensures stability of all of the Ark&rsquo;s myriad celestial systems.</li>\n<li><em>The Stowaway</em>. Hidden away within the Ark&rsquo;s vast hangars, the Stowaway, a skath&aacute;ri female, remembers the old ways of nature and survival.</li>\n<li><em>The Gunner</em>. A tiefling of ambiguous gender, the Gunner manages the powerful weapons attached to the Ark and brings them to bear against those who seek to challenge it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is difficult, however, to parse religion in absolutes. Some people believe the Chosen and their Ark are merely a metaphor, a guideline by which to live a more perfect life. Others, however, believe the Chosen to be real, immortal beings traveling the universe in an omnipotent ship. Historians, meanwhile, suggest that the story of the Chosen and the Ark might be loosely derived from some ancient tale of a real ship that underwent a fateful journey past the edge of the galaxy and never returned.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Whatever the truth is, the Temple adheres strictly to the belief that the Chosen are divinity, whose celestial ship grants them dominion over all worlds in the 'verse. According to Temple doctrine, the faithful are guided to the Ark after death, where they might join the Chosen on their celestial journey.</p>\n<h2>The Tower</h2>\n<div><img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/the-tower.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"285\" height=\"256\" /></div>\n<p>Spacers with a penchant for conspiracy theories will claim all sorts of things about the Tower: that they are a secret society of wizards responsible for manipulating elections, brainwashing children, poisoning the waters of High Terra, and much more. According to these sources, the Tower is always in the shadows, pulling strings and attempting the hide the truth from the people. The truth is that people know very little about the Tower, save for its secrecy and its fraternal nature.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Tower is, indeed, a secret society of arcanists rife with cryptic ciphers and esoteric rites. It traces its origins back to Terminus the First, the same mage (now lich) who established the Hegemony of Man and expanded its boundaries. Terminus ostensibly founded the Tower as a fraternal order to unite arcanists from across the stars, but its clandestine nature makes its true intentions hard to discern. The Tower&rsquo;s inner-sanctums are closed to those who do not undergo their esoteric induction rituals, its agents speak in coded language, and the highest echelons of its memberships share profound secrets unknown to all others, including lower-ranking Tower agents.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Tower largely concerns itself with collecting and sequestering secrets, forbidden lore, and powerful artifacts. Whenever a new arcane relic comes to light, agents of the Tower are never far behind, investigating any strange occurrences and disappearing, relic in stow, as swiftly as they arrived. Their response times are infamous, for agents arrive at incidents almost as if they were given advance warning; it&rsquo;s hard to say which is more paranoid, that the Tower might have to do with the dissemination of dangerous magic relics, or that they have a secret web of eyes and ears, monitoring everything, always searching for them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Perhaps the Tower is truly a conspiratorial network of powerful arcanists with a grand agenda, or perhaps, for all its trappings, it&rsquo;s more like an arcane boy&rsquo;s club, trading secrets and restricting membership to the select few. It&rsquo;s even possible that the Tower sees itself as acting in the galaxy&rsquo;s interest by securing powerful artifacts and spells before they can fall into the wrong hands. What is certainly true is that the Tower&rsquo;s agents are as numerous as they are undetectable, that its libraries contain forbidden arcane knowledge, and that only a few know its true intentions.</p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/graxs-guys.png","_id":"tdMDFFXK19BJ0eXw"}

Coming and going in the middle of the night to dissect livestock and experiment on intelligent creatures, amoeboid ships are somewhat infamous for their role in researching primitive worlds. More often, however, amoeboid saucers and motherships can be found hovering around and leaping between maw stations, their symmetric, sophisticated designs perfectly reflecting that of most amoeboid technology, including much of the maws themselves.</p>\n<h2>Avia-Ra Ships</h2>\n<p>The mighty arm of the avia-ra in the Holy Lands is the Congregation, a fleet of righteous ships dedicated to carrying the fury and enlightenment of the Sun Above to heretics the universe over. Its flagship, The Prophet, is a vessel of terrifying might, and is said to have burned its mark into every elven ship it crossed during the days of the Night Crusade. Now, it slumbers peacefully with much of the Congregation in a large perimeter around the Sepulcher Star, awaiting another grand Crusade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avia-Ra ships demonstrate a meeting of traditional design, canny ingenuity, and startling ruthlessness. There is no better evidence of this than the scorchers borne by most ships in the Congregation: a powerful symbol of the Sun's might, and also a deceptively simple circumvention of elven shield technology.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;When you see that ship&rsquo;s firepower, you can feel it in your bones.&rdquo;<br />&mdash; Dietrich Hildbrand, human mercenary captain, on seeing The Prophet</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Dwarven Ships</h2>\n<p>Dwarven shipwrights are renowned for their craftsmanship and engineering, and as such, dwarven ships are the gold standard for quality and dependability. If properly maintained, a dwarven vessel can see centuries of continuous use, long outliving its creators. These machines are designed to tackle tough jobs&mdash;asteroid mining, interstellar hauling, and deep space salvage&mdash;and are named appropriately, but never seem to break down; indeed, they almost seem to perform better when the going gets rough.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dwarven starship designs and innovations have been adapted and emulated by all comers, leaving the marks of Jormund engineers on human, vect, and avia-ra ships.</p>\n<h2>Elven Ships</h2>\n<p>Elven ships aren't so much constructed as grown, shaped from living ironwood trees. Indeed, there are few vessels in existence that can match an elven ship for beauty or speed. Many are made to resemble traditional sailing ships, with similar bows, sails, and open decks, but all components are formed from great boughs and limbs of ironwood. Pound for pound, no metal can match ironwood for strength, and elven ships rely on this strength and lightness to achieve extreme maneuverability.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As elven ships grow larger, they become more arboreal, with weapons mounted in high limbs and engines fixed in the deepest roots. The grandest of vessels, such as The Hyperion, are thriving cities in their own right, centers of arcane knowledge, and symbols of elven superiority for the rest of the &lsquo;verse.</p>\n<h2>Gnomish Ships</h2>\n<p>A bitter diatribe on prevailing magical technology, gnomish vessels are the epitome of high-tech, cruising through the stars without so much as an arcane battery. As such, gnomes can fly without hindrance into Dead Magic Zones and can penetrate deep into the uncharted territory beyond. The largest Dead Magic Zones even provide some measure of protection for the Gnomish Flotilla, the permanent armada of gnomish ships, and demonstrate the spite most gnomes hold for magic in general: even approaching the Flotilla from the wrong angle will strand an ordinary ship without power in the Black, a death sentence for those who are not promptly rescued.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The advances and complexities of gnomish ships are due to their growing mastery of a baffling art known as science. Guided by this philosophy, gnomish ships are apt to follow different naming conventions: blasters are more likely to be called lasers, sickbays are more likely to be called hospitals, and so on.</p>\n<h2>Human Ships</h2>\n<p>When humans look at the vast emptiness of space, they&rsquo;re not crushed by a weight of burden, nor are they confounded by its meaning; they are instead overwhelmed by an urge to explore. Humans are a young race in the grand scheme of things, but they have made leaps and bounds technologically, bolstering the Hegemony and setting human spacecraft apart from others.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pragmatic almost to a fault, human ships are always purpose-driven in form. Freelancers excel for lone agents, Explorers can probe the farthest depths of space, and Warbringers are utterly ruthless in combat. Regardless of intended function, human ships are innovative and rugged, capable of meeting any trial the &lsquo;verse throws their way.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"We're seeking out new life and civilizations. To blow them to pieces. Welcome to The Antioch, Hegemony warbringer, heavy cruiser class.\"<br />&mdash; Admiral Banebridge's introduction to civilians touring The Antioch</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Lakshayan Ships</h2>\n<p>The Lakshayan people are warriors, ever battle-hardened against the Warhorde, and their ships are a testament to their readiness. In the War of Expansion, the garrison at Lakshay needed a weapon that could engage the goblinoid enemy on land, in the air, and in space, and they had little resources to accomplish this, apart from a new shipment of impulse frames, designed with space marines in mind. With these frames, the Lakshayan engineers devised the first Battle Frame, a gargantuan, rocket-powered, mechanized exoskeleton, armed with a sword and salvos of micro-missiles. Each Frame requires a seasoned pilot, but their sheer versatility and mobility makes them a terror to orcs, and a devastating weapon for any theater of conflict.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than just a ship, a Lakshayan battle frame is an extension of the pilot, and using one is a dance of tactical maneuvers and precision strikes. The deadliest Lakshayan pilots, called Oni, are as fearsome in person as they are in a frame.</p>\n<h2>Nautilid Ships</h2>\n<p>Lonely nautilid whorl ships wander the galaxy, searching for a world that might not even exist. When their homeworld of Poseidon was destroyed, the only haven left to the nautilid race were their immense ships, filled with the rare aqueous solution in which they can thrive. Indeed, whereas other ships and life suits are designed to withhold a volume of air, nautilid ships and suits are pumped with water and a cocktail of minerals specific to their race. Visitors to nautilid ships, therefore, need to prepare as if going on a deep dive or a spacewalk before coming aboard.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The design of whorl ships, and the smaller pincer ships, are inspired by the long-dead undersea creatures of Poseidon; their hulls resemble great shells, and their landing gear, immense legs. True to their name, pincers are even armed with immense crab claws, capable of shredding smaller craft in a matter of minutes.</p>\n<h2>Orc Ships</h2>\n<p>Never let it be said that orc ships aren't at least effective. Industrial in the sense that they run on gasoline, coal, and other crude sources, orc ships spout smoke and sputter flame as they tear across the sky. These pragmatic design influences are matched with strictly aesthetic ones: an orcish rig can usually be found with attractive accessories and an eye-catching paint job.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other goblinoids, including bugbears and goblins, also tend to tend to use general orc ship designs, but take far less care with the workmanship, leading to uneven hulls and barely-stable Dark Matter cores. These ships have garnered the moniker &ldquo;scrap ships&rdquo;, whereas true orc ships are called &ldquo;rigs&rdquo; or &ldquo;rides&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the model, a small contingent of orc ships make a ready fighting force, as they are sensibly built and battle-tested in the Warzone.</p>\n<h2>Vect Ships</h2>\n<p>No craft in existence works precisely like a vect ship. Utilitarian to the point of volatility, vect ships abandon all systems and features not strictly related to their operation, forgoing even life-support; after all, vect don't need to breathe, and the exposed arcane engines powering their ships provide just enough heat to keep the pilot from freezing to death. Exploiting their nature as living constructs, vect pilots plug directly into their ships, creating something of a hybrid intelligence, split between the pilot, the ship, and the swarm as a whole. The link is inherently frail; removing the pilot incorrectly or critically damaging the ship invariably results in a ship-wide detonation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the centuries following the Night Crusade and the liberation of vect in the galaxy, most vect ships have been decommissioned&mdash;their volatility proving to be too much of a liability for everyday use. But some militant splinter cells of vect, often separatists or religious zealots, can still be found employing the designs, which, though inherently nstable, are extremely formidable in combat.</p>\n<h2>Wrothian Ships</h2>\n<p>Wrothian ships are like a thing out of a nightmare. Their inky black shells are almost featureless, with smooth<br />curves that lend them an alien silhouette from every angle. But within those shells is something even stranger: a living, organic interior.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as other wrothian technology, like collection vats and brains in a jar, is alive with a kind of bestial intelligence, so too are their ships. On the inside, the chitinous black exoskeletons give way to tough, crimson tissue that lines the walls and hallways. Structures of black chitin form biomechanical interfaces, devices, rooms, and hallways. A stygian ship can nearly pilot itself, but is driven by psionic impulse from wrothian primarchs, who reside near the ship's nervous center.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These ships are nourished by the same psionic energy that sustains the wroth themselves; they are integral to the wrothian lifecycle. Deep in the Black, the wroth inhabit their stygian ships, emerging only to raid planets for humanoids, harvesting them for their bio-matter and minds. These minds are processed into brains in a jar, whose psionic potential nourishes the ships and the wrothians themselves, perpetuating the cycle.</p>\n<h2>Miscellaneous Ships</h2>\n<p>The following ships are evidence of convergent design in action: whereas flying cars, freighters, and space stations are constructed by engineers of every race, the most efficient designs transcend industrial trends favored by different empires. Though an elven flying car might be made of sleek ironwood and a dwarven one would feature hard angles and a more spacious trunk, they're both more alike than they are different, and consequently share the same statistics.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pragmatic but inefficient designs also belong in this category. The Battle Planetoid, for example, is an asteroid or small moon retrofitted with engines, life support, and a small Dark Matter engine. Though utterly impractical, goblins, kobolds, and other small races have utilized this design time and again.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The exception to this rule is a ship that literally belongs nowhere else: the Infinity is a legendary vessel, made by no race living today. Endlessly cycling the galaxy, this ship crosses its breadth each day on an unpredictable course, falling out of void jumps just long enough to charge up the next one. Glimpsing it between jumps is a one in a billion occasion. No one knows who designed the ship and set it on its lonely orbit, and to date, no one has been able to approach and board the ship before it once again jumps. It is an enigma; perhaps a relic of an ancient galactic empire, a visitor from another galaxy, or something even stranger.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/ship-pg157.png"}

Coming and going in the middle of the night to dissect livestock and experiment on intelligent creatures, amoeboid ships are somewhat infamous for their role in researching primitive worlds. More often, however, amoeboid saucers and motherships can be found hovering around and leaping between maw stations, their symmetric, sophisticated designs perfectly reflecting that of most amoeboid technology, including much of the maws themselves.</p>\n<h2>Avia-Ra Ships</h2>\n<p>The mighty arm of the avia-ra in the Holy Lands is the Congregation, a fleet of righteous ships dedicated to carrying the fury and enlightenment of the Sun Above to heretics the universe over. Its flagship, The Prophet, is a vessel of terrifying might, and is said to have burned its mark into every elven ship it crossed during the days of the Night Crusade. Now, it slumbers peacefully with much of the Congregation in a large perimeter around the Sepulcher Star, awaiting another grand Crusade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avia-Ra ships demonstrate a meeting of traditional design, canny ingenuity, and startling ruthlessness. There is no better evidence of this than the scorchers borne by most ships in the Congregation: a powerful symbol of the Sun's might, and also a deceptively simple circumvention of elven shield technology.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;When you see that ship&rsquo;s firepower, you can feel it in your bones.&rdquo;<br />&mdash; Dietrich Hildbrand, human mercenary captain, on seeing The Prophet</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Dwarven Ships</h2>\n<p>Dwarven shipwrights are renowned for their craftsmanship and engineering, and as such, dwarven ships are the gold standard for quality and dependability. If properly maintained, a dwarven vessel can see centuries of continuous use, long outliving its creators. These machines are designed to tackle tough jobs&mdash;asteroid mining, interstellar hauling, and deep space salvage&mdash;and are named appropriately, but never seem to break down; indeed, they almost seem to perform better when the going gets rough.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dwarven starship designs and innovations have been adapted and emulated by all comers, leaving the marks of Jormund engineers on human, vect, and avia-ra ships.</p>\n<h2>Elven Ships</h2>\n<p>Elven ships aren't so much constructed as grown, shaped from living ironwood trees. Indeed, there are few vessels in existence that can match an elven ship for beauty or speed. Many are made to resemble traditional sailing ships, with similar bows, sails, and open decks, but all components are formed from great boughs and limbs of ironwood. Pound for pound, no metal can match ironwood for strength, and elven ships rely on this strength and lightness to achieve extreme maneuverability.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As elven ships grow larger, they become more arboreal, with weapons mounted in high limbs and engines fixed in the deepest roots. The grandest of vessels, such as The Hyperion, are thriving cities in their own right, centers of arcane knowledge, and symbols of elven superiority for the rest of the &lsquo;verse.</p>\n<h2>Gnomish Ships</h2>\n<p>A bitter diatribe on prevailing magical technology, gnomish vessels are the epitome of high-tech, cruising through the stars without so much as an arcane battery. As such, gnomes can fly without hindrance into Dead Magic Zones and can penetrate deep into the uncharted territory beyond. The largest Dead Magic Zones even provide some measure of protection for the Gnomish Flotilla, the permanent armada of gnomish ships, and demonstrate the spite most gnomes hold for magic in general: even approaching the Flotilla from the wrong angle will strand an ordinary ship without power in the Black, a death sentence for those who are not promptly rescued.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The advances and complexities of gnomish ships are due to their growing mastery of a baffling art known as science. Guided by this philosophy, gnomish ships are apt to follow different naming conventions: blasters are more likely to be called lasers, sickbays are more likely to be called hospitals, and so on.</p>\n<h2>Human Ships</h2>\n<p>When humans look at the vast emptiness of space, they&rsquo;re not crushed by a weight of burden, nor are they confounded by its meaning; they are instead overwhelmed by an urge to explore. Humans are a young race in the grand scheme of things, but they have made leaps and bounds technologically, bolstering the Hegemony and setting human spacecraft apart from others.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pragmatic almost to a fault, human ships are always purpose-driven in form. Freelancers excel for lone agents, Explorers can probe the farthest depths of space, and Warbringers are utterly ruthless in combat. Regardless of intended function, human ships are innovative and rugged, capable of meeting any trial the &lsquo;verse throws their way.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"We're seeking out new life and civilizations. To blow them to pieces. Welcome to The Antioch, Hegemony warbringer, heavy cruiser class.\"<br />&mdash; Admiral Banebridge's introduction to civilians touring The Antioch</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Lakshayan Ships</h2>\n<p>The Lakshayan people are warriors, ever battle-hardened against the Warhorde, and their ships are a testament to their readiness. In the War of Expansion, the garrison at Lakshay needed a weapon that could engage the goblinoid enemy on land, in the air, and in space, and they had little resources to accomplish this, apart from a new shipment of impulse frames, designed with space marines in mind. With these frames, the Lakshayan engineers devised the first Battle Frame, a gargantuan, rocket-powered, mechanized exoskeleton, armed with a sword and salvos of micro-missiles. Each Frame requires a seasoned pilot, but their sheer versatility and mobility makes them a terror to orcs, and a devastating weapon for any theater of conflict.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than just a ship, a Lakshayan battle frame is an extension of the pilot, and using one is a dance of tactical maneuvers and precision strikes. The deadliest Lakshayan pilots, called Oni, are as fearsome in person as they are in a frame.</p>\n<h2>Nautilid Ships</h2>\n<p>Lonely nautilid whorl ships wander the galaxy, searching for a world that might not even exist. When their homeworld of Poseidon was destroyed, the only haven left to the nautilid race were their immense ships, filled with the rare aqueous solution in which they can thrive. Indeed, whereas other ships and life suits are designed to withhold a volume of air, nautilid ships and suits are pumped with water and a cocktail of minerals specific to their race. Visitors to nautilid ships, therefore, need to prepare as if going on a deep dive or a spacewalk before coming aboard.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The design of whorl ships, and the smaller pincer ships, are inspired by the long-dead undersea creatures of Poseidon; their hulls resemble great shells, and their landing gear, immense legs. True to their name, pincers are even armed with immense crab claws, capable of shredding smaller craft in a matter of minutes.</p>\n<h2>Orc Ships</h2>\n<p>Never let it be said that orc ships aren't at least effective. Industrial in the sense that they run on gasoline, coal, and other crude sources, orc ships spout smoke and sputter flame as they tear across the sky. These pragmatic design influences are matched with strictly aesthetic ones: an orcish rig can usually be found with attractive accessories and an eye-catching paint job.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other goblinoids, including bugbears and goblins, also tend to tend to use general orc ship designs, but take far less care with the workmanship, leading to uneven hulls and barely-stable Dark Matter cores. These ships have garnered the moniker &ldquo;scrap ships&rdquo;, whereas true orc ships are called &ldquo;rigs&rdquo; or &ldquo;rides&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the model, a small contingent of orc ships make a ready fighting force, as they are sensibly built and battle-tested in the Warzone.</p>\n<h2>Vect Ships</h2>\n<p>No craft in existence works precisely like a vect ship. Utilitarian to the point of volatility, vect ships abandon all systems and features not strictly related to their operation, forgoing even life-support; after all, vect don't need to breathe, and the exposed arcane engines powering their ships provide just enough heat to keep the pilot from freezing to death. Exploiting their nature as living constructs, vect pilots plug directly into their ships, creating something of a hybrid intelligence, split between the pilot, the ship, and the swarm as a whole. The link is inherently frail; removing the pilot incorrectly or critically damaging the ship invariably results in a ship-wide detonation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the centuries following the Night Crusade and the liberation of vect in the galaxy, most vect ships have been decommissioned&mdash;their volatility proving to be too much of a liability for everyday use. But some militant splinter cells of vect, often separatists or religious zealots, can still be found employing the designs, which, though inherently nstable, are extremely formidable in combat.</p>\n<h2>Wrothian Ships</h2>\n<p>Wrothian ships are like a thing out of a nightmare. Their inky black shells are almost featureless, with smooth<br />curves that lend them an alien silhouette from every angle. But within those shells is something even stranger: a living, organic interior.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as other wrothian technology, like collection vats and brains in a jar, is alive with a kind of bestial intelligence, so too are their ships. On the inside, the chitinous black exoskeletons give way to tough, crimson tissue that lines the walls and hallways. Structures of black chitin form biomechanical interfaces, devices, rooms, and hallways. A stygian ship can nearly pilot itself, but is driven by psionic impulse from wrothian primarchs, who reside near the ship's nervous center.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These ships are nourished by the same psionic energy that sustains the wroth themselves; they are integral to the wrothian lifecycle. Deep in the Black, the wroth inhabit their stygian ships, emerging only to raid planets for humanoids, harvesting them for their bio-matter and minds. These minds are processed into brains in a jar, whose psionic potential nourishes the ships and the wrothians themselves, perpetuating the cycle.</p>\n<h2>Miscellaneous Ships</h2>\n<p>The following ships are evidence of convergent design in action: whereas flying cars, freighters, and space stations are constructed by engineers of every race, the most efficient designs transcend industrial trends favored by different empires. Though an elven flying car might be made of sleek ironwood and a dwarven one would feature hard angles and a more spacious trunk, they're both more alike than they are different, and consequently share the same statistics.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pragmatic but inefficient designs also belong in this category. The Battle Planetoid, for example, is an asteroid or small moon retrofitted with engines, life support, and a small Dark Matter engine. Though utterly impractical, goblins, kobolds, and other small races have utilized this design time and again.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The exception to this rule is a ship that literally belongs nowhere else: the Infinity is a legendary vessel, made by no race living today. Endlessly cycling the galaxy, this ship crosses its breadth each day on an unpredictable course, falling out of void jumps just long enough to charge up the next one. Glimpsing it between jumps is a one in a billion occasion. No one knows who designed the ship and set it on its lonely orbit, and to date, no one has been able to approach and board the ship before it once again jumps. It is an enigma; perhaps a relic of an ancient galactic empire, a visitor from another galaxy, or something even stranger.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/ship-pg157.png"}

{"name":"Chapter 6: Ships - Ship Combat","permission":{"default":0,"PmXouJxFyK2lSXOA":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.oTqHu3oEMVnxJMZ7"}},"content":"<div title=\"Page 194\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h1>Ship Combat</h1>\n<p>Combat between starships is a deadly and unforgiving game, for the loser is subjected to the lifeless, infinite void of space.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ship combat follows most of the same rules and conventions as ordinary combat; for example, ships follow an initiative order and generally play on a 2D plane.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ship movement is covered in the Pilot role and ship attacks are covered in the Gunner role. The Captain, Dogfighter, and Engineer roles are optional; a captain provides extra actions to the crew, the engineer manages power flow and shields, and a dogfighter detaches from the main ship to target the weak points on enemy craft.</p>\n<h2>Initiative</h2>\n<p>When ship combat begins, each character must take a role on the ship to participate. A character's actions with regards to the ship are limited to the role they choose. Entire enemy ships act on a single turn of the initiative order, whereas individual characters act separately. However, if a character is in the role of the Captain, the entire crew can act on a single turn of the initiative order.</p>\n<h2>Character Roles</h2>\n<p>Each character on a starship chooses one of the following roles when they roll initiative. Depending on the ship, some roles, such as Gunner, might be occupied by one character, more than one character, or might not exist at all. By contrast, roles like Pilot are usually occupied only by one character.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A character can switch roles with another character or can switch to an unoccupied role as an action.</p>\n<h3>Captain</h3>\n<p>As the captain, you direct the ship's operations and manage the crew. If you choose to be the captain when the ship rolls initiative, you roll initiative for the entire ship. The entire party acts on that turn in the initiative order while you are captain, and you can choose in which order the crew members take their turns. If you leave the Captain role or fall unconscious, the party rolls initiative separately at the end of the next initiative order.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a captain, you can use the following actions:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Boarding Party</em></strong>. When the conditions for Boarding are met, you can use your action as the captain to form a boarding party (which you can choose to be a part of) and deploy the umbilicus.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong><em>Brace for Impact</em></strong>. You can use your action to brace the ship for damage. Each time your ship takes damage before the beginning of your next turn, you can roll 1d6 and subtract the number rolled from the mega damage your ship takes, to a minimum of 1.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div title=\"Page 194\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Deep Scan</strong></em>. If your ship is equipped with sensors, you can use your action to order a deep scan of a specific object of interest within range of the sensors. This allows you to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check to examine that object.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Fire at Will</strong></em>. You use your action to declare a barrage. One gunner of your choice can then use its reaction to make one attack with a ship weapon.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Full Speed Ahead</strong></em>. You use your action to push the engines. The pilot can then use its reaction to move the ship half its movement within the cone of movement.</p>\n<h3>Dogfighter</h3>\n<p>You deploy in a lighter, more maneuverable vessel to disable enemy fighters and target the vital locations of hostile ships. You can use your action to launch your fighter-sized ship from the main ship or to dock with it while you are adjacent to it. You can only switch roles while your fighter is docked with the main ship.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once launched, you can move your fighter's entire speed on its turn and use your action to fire its weapons. Movement and weapon attacks follow the same rules<br />as the Pilot&rsquo;s Move action and the Gunner&rsquo;s Open Fire action, except that moving your fighter doesn't require an action. You can also take the Pilot&rsquo;s Dogfighting action.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your fighter drops to 0 hit points and is destroyed, you can use your reaction to eject from the craft in a life pod to survive the explosion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While acting as a dogfighter, you can take the following special action:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Targeted Attack</strong></em>. While you are within 1,000 feet of another ship, you can use your action to attempt to disable one of that ship&rsquo;s systems. When you do so, make an attack targeting the ship with disadvantage. On a hit, you deal damage directly to a system of your choice, a weapon of your choice, or the ship&rsquo;s impulse engines. If the attack is blocked by a shield, the damage is subtracted from the target ship&rsquo;s shield points before it damages any system. Systems, weapons, and engines have 10 mega hit points each. Damage to systems is also deducted from the target ship&rsquo;s hit points.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a system or weapon drops to 0 hit points, it is disabled. Any creature operating a weapon when it is destroyed takes normal damage (as opposed to mega damage) equal to the damage dealt. If the engines drop to 0 hit points, the ship is crippled and can only move at half speed.</p>\n<h3>Engineer</h3>\n<p>As the engineer, you can direct power around the ship and position the ship's directional shield. By default, the shield is forward-facing and active.</p>\n<p>The ship's shield covers only one of the ship's four sides. As a bonus action, you can switch the direction the shield faces. If an attack hits the ship on its shielded side, damage is subtracted from the ship's shield points, rather than its hit points.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the initiative order, the shield regains half its maximum shield points, rounded up.</p>\n<p>As an engineer, you have the following actions available to you:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Directing Power</strong></em>. You can use your action to deactivate the shield and direct its power elsewhere: either to the impulse engines or into one of the ship&rsquo;s weapons. If you invest the power in the ship&rsquo;s engines, the ship&rsquo;s movement speed increases by half until the beginning of your next turn. If you invest the power in one of the ship&rsquo;s weapons, a gunner can make one additional attack using that weapon when they take the Open Fire action.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can draw power from the ship&rsquo;s weapons and invest it in the ship's shields. When you do so, until the beginning of your next turn, the ship's shields&nbsp;cover two of its consecutive sides, instead of only one, and it regains all of its shield points at the beginning of the initiative order, instead of only half. In exchange, each gunner makes one weapon attack fewer than normal when they take the Open Fire action.</p>\n<div title=\"Page 195\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<p><em><strong>Overcharge</strong></em>. If you are a spellcaster, you can use your action to expend a spell slot with a level greater than or equal to the Dark Matter engine's class to overcharge the engine. The shield recharges completely, and until the beginning of your next turn, power is invested in the ship&rsquo;s engines (increasing the ship&rsquo;s movement speed by half) and every gun (allowing each gunner to make one additional attack using that weapon when they take the Open Fire action on their turn). Once you use this ability, you can&rsquo;t use it again for 1 minute.</p>\n<p><em><strong>System Repair</strong></em>. You can use your action to repair a ship system or weapon that has 0 hit points and is deactivated. When you do so, make a DC 15 Intelligence (Technology) check. On a success, the system or weapon regains 1 mega hit point and reactivates at the beginning of your next turn.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Void Jump</strong></em>. You can begin the charging process for a void jump. Once a Dark Matter engine has begun to charge, it will jump in 1 minute. No intervention can stop or slow this process; once it is begun, nothing short of destroying the ship can interrupt the jump. The pilot is responsible for guiding the ship on the jump itself and rolls on the Jump Navigation table when the jump begins.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div title=\"Page 196\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h3>Gunner&nbsp;</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div title=\"Page 194\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div title=\"Page 196\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Acquiring targets and calculating ranges, you fire the shipboard weapons on hostile targets. Many ship weapons don't have any facing rules, but those which do are normally mounted to the front or to one of the sides of the ship. If a weapon has the Facing property, it can only be fired in a 90-degree cone in the direction in which it was mounted.</p>\n<p>While you are in the Gunner role, you can only operate one of the ship&rsquo;s weapons at a time. You can use a bonus action on your turn to switch between weapons.</p>\n<p>You add your proficiency bonus and Dexterity modifier to an attack roll you make with a ship&rsquo;s weapon, but you don't add any ability modifier to the weapon&rsquo;s damage rolls. Weapon entries in the Example Ships section include an example attack bonus, to be used only if the GM controls the ship as an NPC.</p>\n<p>As a gunner, you can take the following actions:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Open Fire</strong></em>. You can take the Attack action on your turn to attack with one of the ship&rsquo;s weapons. You can make multiple attacks with this weapon if you have a feature, such as Extra Attack, that gives you extra attacks.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Readied Attacks</strong></em>. You can use your action to ready an attack with a ship&rsquo;s weapon, just as you would ready an attack with a normal weapon. Often, this readied action is used to target deployed weapons, such as neutron torpedoes, the moment they are launched, or to strike another ship the moment it opens fire.</p>\n<h3>Pilot</h3>\n<p>As the pilot, you navigate and direct the ship's movement. Each ship has a given speed in hundreds of feet per turn, and a maneuverability score, which is given in degrees. Additionally, each ship faces a particular direction, which is normally in 45-degree intervals, and can be approximated using the eight cardinal directions.</p>\n<p>To approximate momentum, each ship's movement is limited to a cone of movement, which extends in the direction your ship is facing and is as wide as the ship&rsquo;s Maneuverability score, measured in degrees.</p>\n<p>As the ship&rsquo;s pilot, you can use the following special actions:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Move</strong></em>. You use your action to move the ship up to its speed within the ship&rsquo;s cone of movement. Once you have finished moving, you can rotate the direction your ship is facing by up to its maneuverability score.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Evasive Maneuvers</strong></em>. If your ship is Corvette-sized or smaller, you can use your action to perform evasive maneuvers instead of moving normally. When you do&nbsp;so, until the beginning of your next turn, you add your Dexterity modifier to the ship's AC and have advantage on Dexterity saving throws you make on behalf of the ship.</p>\n<div title=\"Page 196\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p><em><strong>Dogfighting</strong></em>. If your ship is Corvette-sized or smaller and a ship of the same size classification is behind you within 1,000 feet, you can use your action to perform a complex maneuver. Make a Dexterity (Piloting) check, contested by the other ship. On a success, following several tight turns, you switch places with that ship. The direction both ships face remains the same.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Hard Turn</strong></em>. If your ship is Corvette-sized or smaller, you can use your action to pull a hard turn, rotating your ship almost on the spot. You move your ship 500 feet in any direction and rotate to face any way you choose.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Match Speed</strong></em>. Your ship attempts to move at the same rate and direction as another ship instead of moving normally. Choose one ship that you can see. Until the beginning of your next turn, your ship moves when that ship does and attempts to maintain the same distance from it and angle to it. If the target ship moves faster, is more maneuverable, or uses Hard Turn to perform a movement you are not normally capable of, this effect ends.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Ram</strong></em>. If your ship is Frigate-sized or smaller (and you feel particularly foolhardy), you can ram your ship directly into a target by moving up to your speed within your cone of movement and entering a ship or mega creature&rsquo;s space. Your ship and the target each take 2d10 mega bludgeoning damage. Larger ships deal and take more damage in a ram: Transport ships deal 3d10, Corvettes and Frigates deal 4d10.</p>\n<h3>Damage and Repair</h3>\n<p>A ship&rsquo;s hit points are given in mega points and ship- based weapons usually deal damage in mega points as well. Optionally, the GM can rule that non-mega damage can&rsquo;t affect things which have mega hit points, and that mega damage is instantly lethal to non-mega targets.</p>\n<p>When a ship takes hit point damage, it represents structural damage to its hull which is not easily repaired. The loss of hit points has no effect on a ship&rsquo;s capabilities until the ship drops to 0 hit points. Individual systems and weapons, however, can be disabled by precision strikes, which is separate from normal hit point damage.</p>\n<p>Ships are immune to poison and psychic damage.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Shield Points</strong></em>. If a ship has a shield generator, hit<br />point damage might instead be subtracted from the ship&rsquo;s shield points (SP), which are measured in mega hit points. Shields only cover a part of a ship, normally only one side. If the shortest line from an attacker to a shielded ship lands on a shielded side (or a corner of a shielded side), damage is subtracted from the ship's shield points, rather&nbsp;than its hit points. If an attack reduces the shield to 0 shield points, any excess damage carries over to hit points.</p>\n<div title=\"Page 197\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>A ship with a shield regains half its maximum shield points, rounded up, at the beginning of the engineer&rsquo;s turn (or the start of the initiative order, if the ship has no engineer).</p>\n<h3>Destruction</h3>\n<p>When a ship drops to 0 hit points, it becomes a blazing wreck. All of its systems, including weapons, engines, and life support, cease to function, and it can&rsquo;t regain hit points. Escape craft, like fighters, life pods, and shuttles can still eject from a blazing wreck. The ship is on a tipping point of complete disaster; it might soon explode outright, or otherwise become a derelict wreck.</p>\n<p>Explosion Saving Throws. If the ship is a blazing wreck at the end of the initiative order, one character makes a unique saving throw, called an explosion saving throw. This saving throw isn&rsquo;t tied to any ability score; it is purely dependent on chance.</p>\n<p>Roll a [[/r d20]]. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, the ship becomes a derelict wreck; it is adrift, and all its systems are still disabled, but it is no longer at risk of exploding and can, with extensive efforts, be repaired. On your third failure, the ship explodes, immediately killing any creatures still onboard. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind.</p>\n<p>Damage at 0 Hit Points. If your ship takes any damage while it is a blazing wreck, it suffers an explosion saving throw failure.</p>\n<h3>Repair</h3>\n<p>Repairing a ship is a difficult process requiring many hours of work. During your downtime, you can perform repairs on your ship. For each day you spend performing repairs, you make a DC 15 Intelligence (Technology) check. If you have proficiency in ship maintenance tools, you can add your proficiency bonus to the check, or double your proficiency bonus if you are also proficient with Technology. On a success, the ship regains mega hit points equal to your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. Alternatively, the ship can be repaired completely in one day at port for a fee of 2 gp per mega hit point lost.</p>\n<h3>Boarding</h3>\n<p>Sometimes, your objective in ship-to-ship combat requires that you come aboard a hostile vessel. You can board another vessel if your ship has an umbilicus, if both ships are within 500 feet of each other, and if the pilot of your ship has Matched Speed with the other. When you do so,&nbsp;any number of crew members or passengers can join a boarding party. The umbilicus only remains attached as long as both ships remain within 500 feet of each other.</p>\n<div title=\"Page 197\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>A boarding party and any hostile crew roll their own initiative which acts parallel to ongoing ship combat. Combat as a boarding party is the same as normal combat.</p>\n<p>The boarding party arrives in a room via the umbilicus and can only return to their own ship through the umbilicus. The captain or engineer of the opposing ship can disengage life support (or choose to only deactivate gravity, atmosphere, or heat) or start a self-destruct timer on the ship. Additionally, if the boarding party accesses important locations, such as the engine room, the shield generator, or a battle station housing a ship weapon, they can use the opportunity to destroy or disable the ship's various systems and weapons.</p>\n<p>If the party eliminates all hostile crew members of the boarded ship, they can commandeer it, provided that they have a knowledgeable pilot and enough crew to operate it.</p>\n<h3>NPC Ships</h3>\n<p>The GM doesn't play the individual roles of an NPC ship separately. Rather, each NPC ship rolls its own initiative and can perform all its relevant actions on its turn. In addition, rather than calculating the statistics of gunners, NPC ships use the attack bonuses included in weapon entries and typically have one gunner at each weapon. The GM also decides the relevant ability checks and saving throws for NPC crewmen.</p>\n<p>If an NPC ship has a Captain role, the GM can also allow the ship to take an additional action on its turn.</p>\n<p>Most GMs have NPC ships immediately explode when dropping to 0 hit points. Common exceptions include when one or more player characters has boarded the ship, or when an important NPC or villain is aboard it. Alternatively, the GM can rule that the characters in question escape aboard a life pod or a shuttle shortly before the ship&rsquo;s explosion.</p>\n<h3>Variant Rule: Grid Combat</h3>\n<p>Ship combat is particularly well-suited to using miniatures on a square-based grid map. Using this rule, each square is 500 feet by 500 feet and each ship faces the side or the corner of their surrounding squares. Ships of Transport size or smaller fit within a single square. On its turn, a ship moves 1 square for every 500 feet of its movement.</p>\n<p>When counting distance on a grid, the first diagonal square counts as 1 square of movement, and the second diagonal square as 2 squares. Repeat this pattern of 1 square, 2 squares whenever you count diagonally, even if you move horizontally or vertically between different bits of movement.</p>\n<div title=\"Page 198\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h3>Variant Rule: Planes of Movement</h3>\n<p>Though ship combat primarily takes place on a 2D plane, you can use this variant rule to convert combat into a semblance of 3D space. When combat begins, the GM decides how many Planes of Movement exist. In open space, there might be three to four, while in orbit around a star, there may only be two.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>When moving your ship, you can expend 1,000 feet of movement to move up or down one Plane of Movement (doing so also moves you 500 feet forward in your cone of movement). When you target ships in other planes of movement, they are treated as being an additional 500 feet away for each plane of movement between your ship and the target. Two ships can pass above or below one another in the same space while in different planes of movement.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/journals/ship-pg157.png","_id":"DdjOFzyRJXlKall5"}

Despite their reputation, few races in the ‘verse are quite as good with a wrench or as quick with a comeback.</p>\n<h1>Pragmatic</h1>\n<p>Orcs tend to be practical, common sense folks, who believe the best solution to a problem is one that works. Working with hardware comes naturally to them, partially because an orcish preteen can lift an engine block, and partially because they find something satisfying in tools that have a purpose and machines that work well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; Most orc technology has developed according to the, “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” mindset, which has led to some truly unique designs. Their ships, which they usually call “rigs” or “rides”, are powered by gasoline, and feature impressive exhaust pipes and air intakes. It’s not uncommon to see one painted with pinstripes, flames, or entire murals. Likewise, their blasters still retain the trappings of ammunition-based guns, with magazines and prominent muzzles.</p>\n<h1>Aftermath of War</h1>\n<p>While history remembers the Warzone as being the consequence of a great orcish war, modern orcs remember almost nothing about the conflict. Their old national identities, on which the war originally centered, have been washed away with centuries of arcane warheads and goblinoid alliances, and those few which can escape the Warzone would rather pretend it didn’t happen. They carry their history and culture with them, and feel a pang for the war that took their homeworld, but claim little responsibility for the violence of the Warzone today.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; Orcs of the ‘verse have undergone a diaspora since losing their homeworld. A surprising number have ended up in the dwarven conclave as full citizens, and nearly as many have taken up residence in the Lakshay garrison. These orcs outside the warzone usually claim the heritages of their adopted homes, and are welcomed in kind. Inside the warzone, however, orcs live among hobgoblin warchiefs which would conscript them into battle, and gnoll marauders which would raid their homes. As such, their life is a migratory one, whether fleeing the violence or pursuing it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/races/orc-engineer.png"}

Suddenly, a spark of blue electricity flashes across the room and scorches the far wall. The gnome grins and puts away his tools.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;An amoeboid carefully positions a rabbit on a pedestal, stands back, and presses a large red button. With a pop and a puff of fur, the rabbit vanishes, only to hop back into the room seconds later, hairless from the waist down. The amoeboid nods and scratches down a few notes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;A bald human woman with a glowing, red, robotic eye tightens the joints on her new cybernetic arm. Her work complete, she rears back her metal fist and crushes a nearby chair.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Gadgeteers are masters of technology and engineering, turning every device available to their advantage. Assisted by their artificial intelligence companions, gadgeteers pursue the cutting edge of science and innovation, acquiring a mass of gadgets and a wealth of knowledge along the way.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Cutting-Edge Innovators</h2>\n<div><img style=\"float: left;\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/classes/gadgeteer-l.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"196\" /></div>\n<p>Impelled by the lure of systems and logic, a wildly eccentric group embraces the sciences. These disparate tinkers, students, and inventors tend to be uniformly welleducated (or at least highly self-educated) in the principles of science, arcana, and engineering, with a particular focus on practical applications. Though most gadgeteers are at least curious about the underlying mysteries of the universe, many view groundbreaking scientific discoveries as a means to an end; theory only exists to facilitate application.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Fueled by breakthroughs and scientific advances, gadgeteers push the cutting edge of science and innovation, devising new technological marvels (or at least new blaster variants) at a breakneck pace. Some gadgeteers become absorbed in a particular problem, innovating and optimizing solutions for it alone, while others devise technological marvels wherever they can find application. All the great advances of the modern world, from datapads to Dark Matter engines, have been spearheaded by gadgeteers.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>AIs</h2>\n<p>A gadgeteer is rarely seen far from the floating holographic orb that is their Artificial Intelligence (AI) companion. After all, an organic brain can only hold so much information, whereas an AI can recall equations, trace schematics, and perform calculations with ease. Such intellect is nothing without a gadgeteer's ingenuity, of course, but the watchful eye of an AI can still spot errors that their creator might not have noticed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;But more than that, an AI companion is also a tireless friend. The endless work of a gadgeteer can often be monotonous and isolating, but the constant, friendly voice of an AI in one's ear goes a long way to preventing mad scientists and doomsday devices.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Creating a Gadgeteer</h2>\n<p>When devising your gadgeteer, consider what draws your character to the sciences. Is it the challenge of working out a new puzzle, or the thrill of perfecting a new invention? Perhaps your character is obsessed with a particular facet of the universe, and longs to unravel its mysteries. Think about how you learned about science and engineering. Did you have a mentor that shaped your understanding, or are you totally self-educated?</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, consider which Prototype you&rsquo;ll pick when you reach 2nd level. Are you interested in having a gadget for every situation, or do you just prefer having a big, hulking mech suit? Consider what this prototype means for your specialization and your character&rsquo;s personality in general. Lastly, put some thought into your AI. What&rsquo;s its name, and what type of personality does it possess, if any?</p>\n<h3>Quick Build</h3>\n<p>Follow these suggestions to quickly build a gadgeteer. Choose Intelligence as your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. Investing in Constitution might also be wise for characters that intend to select the Experimental Frame Prototype at 2nd level. For your equipment, choose a researcher&rsquo;s pack and an antimatter dagger. Lastly, choose the Technologist background.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>Class Features</h1>\n<p>As a gadgeteer, you gain the following class features:</p>\n<h3>Hit Points</h3>\n<p><strong>Hit Dice</strong>: 1d6 per gadgeteer level</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level</strong>: 6 + your Constitution modifier</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels</strong>: 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per gadgeteer level after 1st</p>\n<h3>Proficiencies</h3>\n<p><strong>Armor</strong>: Light armor</p>\n<p><strong>Weapons</strong>: Simple and martial blasters, simple weapons</p>\n<p><strong>Tools</strong>: Alchemist&rsquo;s supplies, circuitry kit, mechanist&rsquo;s tools, ship maintenance tools, smith&rsquo;s tools, tinker tools</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throws</strong>: Intelligence, Dexterity</p>\n<p><strong>Skills</strong>: Choose three from Arcana, Data, Deception, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Piloting, Religion, Sleight of Hand, or Technology</p>\n<h3>Equipment</h3>\n<p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A repeater and any simple weapon</li>\n<li>(a) a martial blaster or (b) two simple blasters</li>\n<li>(a) a circuitry kit or (b) a mechanist&rsquo;s tools</li>\n<li>An engineer&rsquo;s pack and leather armor</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>AI Companion</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 1st level, you are assisted by an AI companion, an intricate data construct which lives on your datapad and possesses near human-like levels of intelligence. When it manifests, it does so as a simple geometric projection; otherwise, it is merely a voice in your ear, checking your reasoning and informing you of relevant information. Your companion can solve any arithmetic or strictly logical problem you pose to it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Additionally, whenever you make an Intelligence (Technology) check, you can treat the result as 10, or your gadgeteer level + your Intelligence modifier, whichever is higher.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Your AI companion downloads and integrates knowledge of additional subjects as you gain higher levels in this class. At 6th level, and again at 10th level and 15th level, you can choose one of the following skills to gain this benefit when you make an Intelligence check with it: Arcana, Data, History, Investigation, Nature, or Religion.</p>\n<h2>Gadgets</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you begin to amass a collection of cutting-edge technological devices called gadgets. You gain one gadget of your choice for which you meet the prerequisites. Because your gadgets are powered by your personal power cell, no other creature can use them. If one of your gadgets is lost or damaged, you can fashion a new one for no cost when you take a long rest.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;You acquire additional gadgets as you gain levels in this class, as shown on the Gadgeteer table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the gadgets you have and replace it with another one that you could gain at that level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Your gadget options are detailed at the end of the class description.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Saving Throws</em>. If one of your gadgets calls for a saving throw, its DC is calculated as follows:</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Gadget save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<h2>Overcharge</h2>\n<p>With your technical aptitude and ingenuity, you can modify blasters to fire in more intense bursts. Starting at 2nd level, once on each of your turns when you hit a target with an attack from a blaster, you can deal an additional die of damage to that target.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;This ability improves as you gain levels in this class. You add an additional die of damage at 5th level (2 dice), 11th level (3 dice), and 17th level (4 dice). Additionally, starting at 11th level, when you use this ability, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the blaster&rsquo;s damage roll.</p>\n<h2>Prototype</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, you make a breakthrough innovation with a prototype of your own design. Choose one of the following three prototypes.</p>\n<h3>Experimental Frame</h3>\n<p>You have developed a sophisticated experimental frame, a powerful exo-suit that augments your strength and shelters you from harm. Your experimental frame counts as heavy armor, which you can don or doff as a bonus action, and it also grants you the benefits of a life suit. You are proficient with your experimental frame, but no other creature can wear it. While wearing your frame, you gain the following benefits:</p>\n<p>&bull; Your size becomes Medium, if it is smaller.</p>\n<p>&bull; Your movement speed increases to 30 feet, if it is less.</p>\n<p>&bull; Your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Intelligence modifier. This armor can't be enchanted or modified to improve its Armor Class.</p>\n<p>&bull; Whenever you begin your turn wearing this frame, you gain temporary hit points equal to your gadgeteer level. These hit points last until you remove the frame.</p>\n<p>&bull; You can integrate a simple or martial weapon directly into your frame, or you can integrate two weapons (one into each arm) if neither has the Two-Handed property. When you draw an integrated weapon, it snaps to your hand and you can&rsquo;t be disarmed of it. Your frame is programmed in all manner of combat protocol, so you can use these integrated weapons proficiently while wearing your frame, even if you're not normally proficient in their use. You can switch which weapons are integrated when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>&bull; When you make an attack with an integrated melee weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of your Strength or Dexterity, for attack and damage rolls.</p>\n<p>&bull; Starting at 5th level, when you make a melee weapon attack with an integrated weapon, you can make an additional melee attack using that weapon as a bonus action.</p>\n<h3>Mechanized Autonomous Construct</h3>\n<p>You have put the finishing touches on a @Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.monsters.gcv0riOmF3lR0gvw]{Mechanized Autonomous Construct} (a MAC), which is a speciallyconstructed automaton piloted by your AI.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The construct has statistics as shown above, and takes its own turn in combat immediately after yours. On your turn, you can mentally command your construct if it is within 500 feet of you (no action required). You decide what action it will take and where it will move during its turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. In combat, your construct's actions are governed by its Combat Protocols, which you can switch as a bonus action on your turn. If you are incapacitated or absent, your AI guides your construct to protect you and itself.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; If your construct drops to 0 hit points, it becomes disabled. When you take a long rest, you can repair your construct to its full hit points. You are always considered to have enough materials to build and repair your construct.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; You can integrate weapons and gadgets directly into your construct. You can integrate one two-handed melee weapon, two one-handed melee weapons, or a one-handed melee weapon and a gadget. When your construct draws an integrated weapon or gadget, the item snaps to its hand and it can&rsquo;t be disarmed of it. Your construct is proficient with any weapons integrated into it. The construct takes the Use an Object action to activate an integrated gadget.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Starting at 5th level, your construct makes two attacks, instead of one, when you command it to take the Attack action with its integrated weapons.</p>\n<h3>Utility Matrix</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; You have developed a utility matrix, an advanced, cubeshaped mechanism that rearranges its form and function into that of other devices. Your matrix can become any of the following gadgets, which you can use at will:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Cloaking Device</strong></em>. As an action, you can activate your cloaking device to temporarily warp the light around you and hide yourself from view. You become invisible until the beginning of your next turn, or until you make an attack, cast a spell, or use a gadget. Once you use this gadget, you can't use it again on the following round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Flashbang</strong></em>. As a bonus action, you throw a concussive bomb at your feet, disorienting and distracting nearby foes. Each creature within 5 feet of you can't take reactions until the start of its next turn. Once you use this gadget, you can't use it again on the following round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Forcefield Projector</strong></em>. As a bonus action, you can activate your forcefield projector, temporarily sheltering yourself behind a powerful electromagnetic field. Until the beginning of your next turn, your Armor Class increases by your Intelligence modifier. Once you use this gadget, you can't use it again on the following round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Grappling Hook</strong></em>. As a reaction when you fall, or as a bonus action on your turn, you can project a grappling hook at a target location you can see within your movement speed. If the target location can hold your weight, you are pulled there, expending movement normally. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. Once you use this gadget, you can't use it again on the following round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Modular Gadget</strong></em>. Starting at 5th level, you can reconfigure your utility matrix into an un-upgraded gadget of your choice that does not have prerequisites. This gadget doesn't count against your total number of gadgets known. Alternately, you can reconfigure your utility matrix into an upgrade for an existing gadget for which you meet prerequisites. Once you reconfigure your utility matrix, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2>Tech Specialty</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 3rd level, you adopt a tech specialty that informs your gadgeteering expertise. Choose one Tech Specialty option. Your selection grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>\n<h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can&rsquo;t increase an ability score<br />above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<h2>Bluescreen Protocol</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 7th level, you have integrated a complex construct-disabling algorithm into your AI companion, which you can activate as an action. Each construct within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw with disadvantage against your Gadget save DC. On a failed save, a construct is incapacitated and its speed is reduced<br />to 0 until the beginning of your next turn, even if it would otherwise be immune to being incapacitated.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h2>Override Protocol</h2>\n<p>At 18th level, your AI companion can upload a devastating virus to seize control of a construct. You can use your action to touch a construct within your reach, which must succeed a Wisdom saving throw against your Gadget save DC or be charmed by you for 1 hour, even if it would otherwise be immune to being charmed. While it is charmed, you can issue commands to the construct while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as attack that creature, run over there, or fetch that object. If the construct completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2>Antimagic Pulse</h2>\n<p>By 20th level, you perfect a cutting-edge device capable of producing an antimagic pulse (abbreviated AMP), a type of energetic burst that completely disrupts and disables magic and machines. You can use your action to throw this device to a location within 60 feet, which explodes in a flash of blue light. This device creates an antimagic field (as per the spell) for 1 minute centered on the device, with the following changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The effect is a 20-foot radius sphere.</li>\n<li>Magical technology (including your gadgets and blasters) count as magic items and are suppressed within the sphere. Blasters can&rsquo;t be used to make attacks while within the sphere, and attacks with them can&rsquo;t penetrate into it.</li>\n<li>Constructs within the sphere are paralyzed for the duration, even if they would otherwise be immune to this condition.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Destroying the device once it is thrown doesn't end its effects early. Once you use this device, it fizzles out. You can make a new one when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h1>Tech Specialties</h1>\n<p>Gadgeteers tend to be well-read on a variety of subjects, from data structures and artificial intelligence to blaster mechanics and engineering, but typically put their finest efforts into a pet project of some sort. While working on other tasks, the details of their pet project are running in the background of their minds, slowly being solved and pieced together, while other work busies their hands.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With enough experience, the subjects of a gadgeteer&rsquo;s hobby become their tech specialty, a topic in which they are as expert as they are captivated. Often, this specialty is coupled with an objective, a goal to be engineered. Gadgeteers will travel great distances to share research on their mutual specialties, exchanging breakthroughs and discoveries in an effort to achieve a common goal.</p>\n<h2>Drone Jockey</h2>\n<p>Most gadgeteers tinker with drones at some point in their career; after all, they&rsquo;re compact, useful projects, with a limited number of moving parts. However, only drone jockeys take this to the extreme of arming themselves with a small army of programmed drones. By linking the drones&rsquo; sensors and construct cores, they create a more cunning swarm intelligence, distributed over the drone network as a whole. This swarm can act almost autonomously, scouting the area and defending the jockey with mechanical efficiency.</p>\n<h3>Hivemaster</h3>\n<p>Starting when you choose this specialty, you gain a special drone controller magic item and a pair of drones. These drones can be any two of the following three: a defense drone, a medical drone, or a recon drone (see Monsters chapter for statistics). Your drone controller is linked to both drones and you can use your bonus action to command all of your drones at once.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your drones are improved in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can add your level to the HP of your drones.</li>\n<li>When one of your drones makes an attack, its attack bonus equals your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.</li>\n<li>When your medical drone heals a creature, it restores 1d10 hit points.</li>\n<li>Your recon drone marks three creatures it can see, instead of only one.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You gain an additional drone of your choice at 6th level (3 drones), 10th level (4 drones), and 14th level (5 drones).</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your <em>drone controller</em> can only command three drones at a time, and only two of those drones can be the same type, but you can deploy a stored drone as an action if one becomes disabled. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can retrofit one of your drones, changing it into a different type.</p>\n<h3>Sacrificial Dive</h3>\n<p>At 6th level, when you are targeted by a ranged attack, you can use your reaction to command one of your drones within 5 feet of you to fly in the way of the attack. This attack targets the drone instead.</p>\n<h3>Focus Fire</h3>\n<p>Beginning at 10th level, your AI companion takes direct control of your drones, aiming and firing them as you direct. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can command your drones without using a bonus action.</p>\n<h3>Omega Drone</h3>\n<p>At 14th level, as an action, you can combine three of your drones (a defense drone, a medical drone, and a recon drone) into a single omega drone. Once combined, the omega drone&rsquo;s AC equals 10 + your Intelligence modifier, its HP equals 5 times your level, and its ability scores are all 14.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The drone can take all the actions of its constituent drones and takes its own turn immediately after yours in initiative, acting as directed by your AI. On a hit with its integrated blaster, it deals 3d6 radiant damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your <em>drone controller</em> can't link to other drones while your omega drone is active. You can separate your omega drone back into its constituent drones as an action.</p>\n<h2>Futurist</h2>\n<p>As a futurist, you believe that artificial intelligence is the zenith of all invention. To engineer a perfect AI, one which is capable of inventing on its own merits, is to conquer limitless problems by proxy. After all, an advanced AI which doesn't degrade into a rogue intelligence could turn its vastly superior intellect to dramatically improving the world, innovating in ways organic minds couldn't imagine. Your experiments with neural networks and intelligence theory have steadily edged you closer to finding such an AI, and granted your AI companion newfound aptitude along the way.</p>\n<h3>Advanced Subroutines</h3>\n<p>Starting when you choose this specialty at 3rd level, your AI takes a more active role in assisting you, rather than merely chirping up from time to time. Your AI can run any of the following subroutines, and you can command it to switch between subroutines as a bonus action.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Genetic Algorithm</em>. When you take damage from a hostile creature, subtract 1 from the damage dealt. Each additional time you take damage while this subroutine is running, the amount you subtract from the damage dealt increases by 1, up to a maximum of your Intelligence modifier. This amount resets to 1 after 1 minute or when you switch subroutines.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Heatmap</em>. When you have advantage on a weapon attack, you can add your proficiency bonus to the damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Neural Network</em>. When you use the Attack action to attack a hostile creature and miss, you gain a cumulative +1 bonus to subsequent attack rolls you make while this subroutine is running, up to a maximum of your Intelligence modifier. You don't increase this bonus if you attempt to attack a creature that you can't see or a creature that can't be hit. This amount resets to 0 after 1 minute or when you switch subroutines.</p>\n<h3>Novel Intelligence</h3>\n<p>At 3rd level, you have vastly improved your AI's intellect. Your AI Companion feature applies its benefit to another Intelligence skill of your choice. Additionally, your AI knows all languages and can perfectly recall everything it has seen and heard within the last 30 days.</p>\n<h3>Tactical Analysis</h3>\n<p>Starting at 6th level, as a bonus action, you can command your AI to perform a full evaluation of your strategic options and advise you of likely scenarios. Until the beginning of your next turn, you have advantage on the next attack roll you make, and the next attack roll made against you has disadvantage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Recursive Deterrence</h3>\n<p>By 10th level, your AI has implemented passive routines that scan for incoming blaster fire and ready you for counterattack. As a reaction when a creature within 15 feet of you makes a ranged weapon attack, you can use your reaction to make a ranged weapon attack targeting that creature.</p>\n<h3>Singularity</h3>\n<p>Beginning at 14th level, your AI is nearly prescient. As a bonus action, you can allow your AI to override your very movements, guiding your shots to where targets will be. For the next minute, whenever you make a ranged attack roll and don't have disadvantage, you can treat the result as being equal to your gadgeteer level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Hardlight Architect</h3>\n<p>Hardlight might well be the penultimate arcane discovery. It is a strong yet malleable material, conjured fully-shaped from energy alone, and it can be used to construct entire functional systems in a flash. Through hardlight, engineers and arcanists can spontaneously prototype new designs in real space and replicate these designs later. Hardlight architects recognize the monumental importance of this material and dedicate their ambition and creativity to mastering it. As you perfect all the established hardlight spells, you constantly dream up new, innovative uses for the material, awaiting the day you can conjure a towering suit of hardlight power armor to crush your enemies and intimidate your rivals.</p>\n<h3>Hardlight Projector</h3>\n<p>When you choose this specialty at 3rd level, you construct a hardlight projector, a device capable of forming hardlight and shaping it to your whims. If the projector is lost or destroyed, you can construct a new one over a long rest for 200 gp. By using this device as an action, you can create a simple geometrical object of shimmering hardlight which must fit within a 1-foot cube. Whatever its shape, the object weighs 1 pound, lasts for 1 minute, has AC 10, and has 5 hit points.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Additionally, you can use the projector to cast the @Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.spells.CsNvRRgV7yDrKnZ6]{hardlight needle} cantrip.</p>\n<h3>Hardlight Spellcasting</h3>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, you can use your hardlight projector to emulate the actions of a spellcaster, enabling you to create more substantial hardlight spells. Your spell save DC for these spells equals your Gadget save DC and your spell attack bonus equals your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You can cast the spells hardlight blaster and hardlight nails once each and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Additionally, at 6th level, you can cast the spells hardlight construction and hardlight gauntlet once each. At 14th level, you can cast the spell hardlight frame once. You regain the ability to cast each of these spells when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Lightforge</h3>\n<p>Starting at 6th level, as a bonus action, you can forge a shield, a set of artisan tools, or any melee weapon that deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, entirely out of scintillating hardlight. After 10 minutes, this object evaporates completely into light.</p>\n<h3>Prototype Luxcannon</h3>\n<p>By 10th level, you&rsquo;ve perfected a stable hardlight weapon, which you can conjure effortlessly. You can cast the spell hardlight blaster at will and can apply your Overcharge feature to the spell.</p>\n<h3>Transient Avatar</h3>\n<p>At 14th level, you can cast the spell conjure hardlight avatar without using a spell slot or spell components as a bonus action. The spell's duration is until the end of your next turn. Once you cast this spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2>Mastermaker</h2>\n<p><img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/classes/avia-ra-gadgeteer.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"297\" />Nearly all gadgeteers strive for perfection in their work, but mastermakers take this to a logical extreme: using the technology at their disposal, they seek to engineer away their own biological defects. By grafting gadgets and technology onto their bodies (and making liberal use of vect components), mastermakers gradually become hybrids of humanoids and machines. They are stronger, tougher, and more agile than their counterparts, but many would argue that their techniques are too extreme&mdash;too unnatural&mdash;no matter what the results.</p>\n<h3>Thermalsight</h3>\n<p>Starting when you choose this specialty at 3rd level, you have installed a vect optical sensor in place of one of your eyes, granting you thermalsight. You can see living creatures through darkness and heavily obscured conditions, such as fog, out to a range of 30 feet. You can also determine if a creature is living or dead though its body heat. However, you can't discern color, nor use this sense to see through illusions, invisibility, or magical darkness. This sense is blocked by one inch of any solid barrier. If you already had thermalsight, its range increases by 30 feet.</p>\n<h3>Embedded Gadgets</h3>\n<p>At 3rd level, you can install one gadget or a one-handed blaster directly into one of your arms. You can&rsquo;t be disarmed of this item and you can use it if at least one of your hands is free. Additionally, you can perfectly conceal this item, so long as another creature does not inspect the metal plates installed in your arm. You can change which gadget or blaster you have embedded when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Additionally, you don&rsquo;t lose hit points or hit dice from installing or removing construct grafts, and it takes you no time to recover after the attachment of a new graft.</p>\n<h3>Carbon Fiber Skin</h3>\n<p>At 6th level, you have installed a durable metallic mesh under much of your skin, and metallic plates to protect your organs. Your Armor Class increases by 1.</p>\n<h3>Reconfigure</h3>\n<p>By 10th level, enough of your body is mechanical that you can reconfigure your parts to improve your agility, might, or even intellect. One ability score of your choice increases by 2 and you can change this selection whenever you finish a long rest. You can't increase Constitution using this trait and you can't increase any ability score above 20.</p>\n<h3>Construct Perfection</h3>\n<p>By 14th level, you have achieved the height of construct superiority by installing a construct core directly into your head. You no longer need to sleep and magic can&rsquo;t put you to sleep. You are immune to being charmed, frightened, or possessed. Additionally, the maximum for your Intelligence score is now 22.</p>\n<h2>Nanoengineer</h2>\n<p>While other gadgeteers tinker with machines that fit in the palm of your hand, your machinations are smaller and your ambitions grander. As a nanoengineer, you work with nanomachines, unfathomably tiny robots capable of massive feats, from stitching together wounds at the microscopic level, to forming extraordinarily resilient materials. Your machines might appear as nothing more than a small blob of gray ooze, but once set to work, their effects are unmistakable.</p>\n<h3>Cutting-Edge Nanobots</h3>\n<p>Beginning when you choose this specialty at 3rd level, you have assembled a fabricator which generates a steady stream of advanced nanobots, called nanites. Your supply of nanites is represented by a pool of Nano points equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your gadgeteer level, rounded down. You can expend Nano points to employ your nanobots in varying ways, described below, and you regain all expended Nano points when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Deconstruct</em>. As an action, you well up a mass of nanites in your hand and fling them at a target within 15 feet of you. Spend any number of Nano points and make a ranged attack roll if the target is out of your reach; you automatically hit if the target is within your reach. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 necrotic damage per Nano point expended as the nanites unravel it at a cellular level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Nano-Hack</em>. You can expend up to 3 Nano points when you make an Intelligence (Data) check to hack a piece of technology, inserting your nanites into the machine. You can add 1d4 to the roll for each Nano point expended.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Reconstruct</em>. As an action, you can expend any number of Nano points to create a thin stream of nanites to repair damage and mend wounds of a willing target within 15 feet of you. The target regains 1d6 hit points per Nano point expended.</p>\n<h3>Nano-Duplicate</h3>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, as a bonus action, you can use your nanites to duplicate the exact shape, but not color or texture, of an object you touch that can fit within a 1-foot cube. The replica is made of nanites and lasts for 10 minutes.</p>\n<h3>Recycling Protocol</h3>\n<p>Starting at 6th level, you've programmed your nanites to repurpose material and multiply. When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points using a melee weapon attack or your Deconstruct ability, you regain 2 expended Nano points.</p>\n<h3>Nanite Weave</h3>\n<p>Starting at 10th level, you can use your action and spend up to 3 Nano points to stitch your nanites together in a protective mesh above your skin. These Nano points are invested in the mesh; you can have up to 3 points invested at once. While you aren't wielding a shield, you gain a bonus to your Armor Class equal to the number of Nano points invested. Whenever you take damage, nanites in the mesh are destroyed and you lose 1 invested point.</p>\n<h3>Network Response</h3>\n<p>Starting at 14th level, you can use your reaction when you take damage to use your Deconstruct ability, targeting the attacker, or Reconstruct ability, targeting yourself, spending up to 3 Nano points on either ability.</p>\n<h1>Gadgets</h1>\n<p><img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/equipment/death-ray.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"212\" /></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Your 'death ray' is just a blaster which kills people? I have an axe that kills people. Does that make it a 'death axe'?\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;- Throg, half-orc barbarian who asks really good questions</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If a gadget or an upgrade has prerequisites, you must meet them to gain it. You can gain a gadget or upgrade at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your gadgets count as magical technology. You must have a gadget before you can select its upgrade. If a gadget calls for a spell or magic item which requires a saving throw, its uses your Gadget save DC.</p>\n<h3>Adaptable Omnitool</h3>\n<p>This gadget can be configured into a number of useful devices, including the following:</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Auto-Entry Device</em>. This device automatically attempts to crack physical locks or hack powered doors when set to do so as an action. Its ability check for doing so is 10 + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Rebreather</em>. You can start or stop breathing through this apparatus as a bonus action. When doing so, you can breathe normally in airless environments. This device also shelters you from toxic fumes and other airborne poisons. You can't talk while breathing through this device.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Scanner</em>. As an action, you can use your handheld scanner to analyze the electromagnetic spectrum around you. Your scanner detects the presence, number, and type of technological devices within 30 feet of you and can determine whether or not a unique construct or device has been present in the area within the last hour.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Taser</em>. This device produces a debilitating current of electricity when you use it as an action. Make a melee attack roll (attack bonus equals your Intelligence bonus + your proficiency modifier) against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 lightning damage, and it can't take reactions until the start of its next turn. This damage increases to 2d8 lightning damage at when you reach 5th level, 3d8 at 11th level, and 4d8 at 17th level.</p>\n<h3>Blink Button</h3>\n<p>This complicated looking device has a single large red button on its face. When you press it as an action, you teleport up to 15 feet to an unoccupied location of your choice that you can see.</p>\n<h3>Bubble Projector</h3>\n<p>You construct a device that, as an action, creates a dome of force as if you had cast the spell geodesic shield. You don't need to concentrate on this spell. Once you use this gadget, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Chronoshifter</h3>\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 17th level</em></p>\n<p>When you use your bonus action to activate this sophisticated, spherical device, you temporarily distort time, as per the spell time stop. Once you use this gadget, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Death Ray</h3>\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 17th level</em></p>\n<p>You construct a death ray magic item.</p>\n<h3>F-MAC</h3>\n<p><em>Prerequisites: Mechanized Autonomous Construct prototype, 5th level</em></p>\n<p>You integrate a set of thrusters into your construct, granting it a flying speed of 30 feet.</p>\n<h3>Feedback Electrodes</h3>\n<p><em>Prerequisites: Utility Matrix Prototype, 5th level</em></p>\n<p>You&rsquo;ve installed an electrical feedback system into your Utility Matrix. When you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to deal 2d6 lightning damage to that creature.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This damage improves as you gain higher levels in this class. At 11th level, you can deal 3d6 damage, and at 17th level, you can deal 4d6 damage.</p>","img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/classes/avia-ra-gadgeteer.png","_id":"undqa3mAnIk4W3t1"}
