See the Ships chapter for more details.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Using a Roach</strong></em>. Consuming a roach triggers a wave of euphoria and mind-expanding effects. Many pilots believe they can see the entire universe after consuming a roach, even though some see terrible visions of the Void. Consuming a roach grants a creature the benefits of the astrogation spell: a perfect jump. Roaches are generally cheaper than hiring an astrogator, but long-term roach use is dangerous and addictive. See Roach Addiction in Appendix E for more information.</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h1>Roaches</h1>\n<p><em>Ocoulori Radavitis</em>, known to many as &ldquo;@Compendium[dark-matter-compendium.equipment.ggdM6Hlnjpo2cCpN]{roaches},&rdquo; are 10-legged psychic insectoid creatures between 2 and 6 inches long. On their homeworld, prior to the advent of spaceflight, Roaches were considered a particularly insidious form of pest, able to leverage their psychic, possibly even precognitive, abilities to avoid extermination. However, since their discovery by interstellar explorers, they have become the single-most valuable commodity in the &lsquo;verse.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When most humanoids eat a live roach, a mindexpanding wave of euphoria and vivid hallucinations, known as &ldquo;the mists,&rdquo; washes over them. Most roach users feel like they can see hidden dimensions of time and space in the mists, as if a curtain concealing the multiverse itself was pulled back and all its secrets were laid bare. However, this mind-altering sensation is fleeting and lasts only for a few short minutes. Worse, it can be addictive and even psychologically damaging, especially&nbsp; with long-term use.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For unknown reasons, a pilot under the influence of these hallucinations is actually able to judge the length of a void jump and navigate it very close to its destination. This side-effect has made roaches invaluable for interstellar travel.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roaches can&rsquo;t be bred in most places, even with good nutrition and habitats. Very few&nbsp; worlds, which apparently lie along unseen intersections in the universe&rsquo;s ley lines, can sustain roach life and allow for new roach broods. Roaches that are taken off-world promptly become infertile and normally die after about a year. Of course, only living roaches cause the mists, so trade of these creatures is extremely competitive.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The crippling psychological addiction isn&rsquo;t the only downside of eating live roaches. Despite their size, roaches are weakly psychic, and can empathetically communicate simple ideas to creatures around them. Strong emotions, like fear and affection, come across most vividly. It is probably some psychic effect at the moment of their deaths that causes the mists, which&nbsp; explains why alchemists have been unable to replicate it. Regardless, more than one pilot has stopped eating roaches&mdash;and willingly endured the terrible withdrawal period&mdash; simply&nbsp; because the pangs of guilt had grown too much to bear.</p>\n</section>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"DM pg. 136","quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":100,"attuned":false,"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"Uncommon","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":"self"},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":"0","per":"","autoDestroy":true},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"consumableType":"poison"},"flags":{"betterRolls5e":{"critRange":{"value":null},"critDamage":{"value":""},"quickDesc":{"value":true},"quickProperties":{"value":true},"quickOther":{"value":true},"quickFlavor":{"value":true},"quickCharges":{"value":{"quantity":false,"use":false}}}},"img":"modules/dark-matter-compendium/images/equipment/roach-Ocoulori-Radavitis.png","effects":[],"_id":"yOPaqdgXVT8z6vDC"}
