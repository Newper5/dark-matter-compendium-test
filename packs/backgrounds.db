The technology level of these planets range from as primitive as spears and bone tools, to as advanced as modern Earth. However, without the innovation of faster-than-light travel or the intervention of a galactic faction, the peoples of these planets will never join the galactic community.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Low-worlders find themselves far from home through a variety of different means. Sometimes, their journeys are purposeful, a planet's first rocketborne steps to the stars above, but most often low-worlders stumble into the wider universe by sheer accident. Mishaps with powerful dimensional or teleportation magic, abductions, and stowing away on visiting spacecraft are all common stories among low-worlders.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Universally, low-worlders are foreigners in the 'verse, discombobulated for several years as they learn the basics of their new surroundings. The dizzying array of races baffles them and the mundane prevalence of spacecraft and other technology astounds them. Despite their naivety with technology and galactic culture, low-worlders often possess finely honed skills forgotten by much of the wider 'verse: you can find no better tracker, fletcher, cobbler, or blacksmith than those from the low worlds.</p>\n<h2>Homeworld</h2>\n<p>You can use the following tables to decide on the technology level of the world from which you originated and to determine how you left it.
